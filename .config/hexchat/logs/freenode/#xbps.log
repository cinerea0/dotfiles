Apr 21 15:20:33 <ahesford>	https://github.com/leahneukirchen/xtools/pull/178
Apr 21 15:20:48 <cinerea0>	Doesn anyone know what the deal is with the texlive license? The one that was being previously used in the templates is no longer valid (GPL-2)
Apr 21 15:21:08 <ahesford>	^ I've added an xlint rule to look for '#unverified' after python_version so we can shake out problematic packages faster
Apr 21 15:22:40 <ahesford>	cinerea0: what do you mean "no longer valid"
Apr 21 15:23:15 <aedinius>	Why are stupid things like tar missing
Apr 21 15:23:42 <ahesford>	from what?
Apr 21 15:24:52 <cinerea0>	ahesford: GPL-2 is not in the list of acceptable licenses here https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/common/travis/license.lst; as such updates to texlive packages are being rejected by Travis
Apr 21 15:25:19 <aedinius>	cinerea0: should be either GPL-2.0-only or GPL-2.0-or-later, depending on which it is.
Apr 21 15:25:20 <ahesford>	Tangentially, that is not the texlive license
Apr 21 15:25:26 <ahesford>	but what aedinius said
Apr 21 15:25:35 <ahesford>	https://tug.org/texlive/LICENSE.TL
Apr 21 15:25:41 <aedinius>	If it's neither of those, it should be what it is.
Apr 21 15:25:53 <ahesford>	Should be "custom:texlive" or something, and vlicense the text into the package
Apr 21 15:28:10 <cinerea0>	Ah, I see. I'll do that. As a side question, is it best practice to try to get the person who has the open pull request to make this change, or should I open my own pull request?
Apr 21 15:28:37 <ahesford>	Probably best to add a comment or review
Apr 21 15:29:24 <ahesford>	In any case, leah2 is working on texlive-bin
Apr 21 15:29:51 <Vaelatern>	+1 for that xtools pr
Apr 21 15:30:05 <leah2>	am i
Apr 21 15:30:10 <ahesford>	weren't you?
Apr 21 15:30:20 <leah2>	i guess we can move it to 2020
Apr 21 15:30:31 <ahesford>	you mentioned you were testing tl2020 last week
Apr 21 15:30:36 <leah2>	yeah
Apr 21 15:31:29 <cinerea0>	I'll leave a review on the open pull request. Thank you!
Apr 21 15:32:37 *	anansi has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
Apr 21 15:35:19 <leah2>	GPL2 sounds correct, the package only contains the installer?
Apr 21 15:35:59 <ahesford>	When I unpack install-tl-unx.tar.gz, it has the LICENSE.TL from the link above
Apr 21 15:36:10 <leah2>	but we are not distributing texlive
Apr 21 15:36:43 <aedinius>	GPL-2.0-or-later
Apr 21 15:37:08 <aedinius>	Wait I looked at the wrong file
Apr 21 15:37:15 <Piraty>	5.4.33_2 just crashed on me durin initramfs/init
Apr 21 15:37:25 <aedinius>	I do not change my answer.
Apr 21 15:37:32 <ahesford>	GPL-2.0-or-later could work
Apr 21 15:37:39 <ahesford>	but that seems like a technicality
Apr 21 15:38:20 <ahesford>	the package contains the installer, but automatically invokes it on install
Apr 21 15:38:36 <leah2>	it's about what binaries we redistribute imo
Apr 21 15:38:44 <aedinius>	Right
Apr 21 15:39:05 <ahesford>	I guess the installer puts /opt/texlive/2020/LICENSE.TL in place, so that ought to be good enough
Apr 21 15:39:08 <Vaelatern>	if xbps-reconfigure runs it instead of xbps-install, we didn't distribute it.
Apr 21 15:39:38 <ahesford>	Either way, the right license is left on disk, I retract my objection
Apr 21 15:39:54 <not-chicken>	https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/21146#issuecomment-617321632
Apr 21 15:39:54 <not-chicken>	Guys I am a bit confused by this, I have kept my previous packages lowercase, matching the executable. Also coz I am too lazy to hit shift while installing :p
Apr 21 15:39:54 <not-chicken>	How do others do this, switch the case or keep the laziness?
Apr 21 15:40:10 -void-packages/#xbps-	leahneukirchen pushed https://is.gd/HIhgyo
Apr 21 15:41:18 <cinerea0>	So in this case, since the installer is licensed under GPL-2, the correct license should be GPL-2.0-or-later?
Apr 21 15:41:53 <ahesford>	not-chicken: you are supposed to honor the case of the package repo

Apr 21 15:44:15 <not-chicken>	Btw is this convention documented somewhere?
Apr 21 15:44:28 <not-chicken>	iirc I didn't saw it in the manual
Apr 21 15:44:59 <Vaelatern>	 239 For those packages the upstream packages name should be used. Remember that
Apr 21 15:45:02 <Vaelatern>	 240 in contrast to many other distributions, void doesn't lowercase package names.

Apr 21 15:46:00 <ahesford>	I named all of the rocm packages lowercase, AMD's naming scheme is a total disaster
Apr 21 15:46:31 <ahesford>	The github repos are things like ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime
Apr 21 15:46:45 <ahesford>	but the tarballs are things like "rocm-3.3.0.tar.gz" and "roc-3.3.0.tar.gz"

Jun 03 15:18:43 <Nilium>	Hm, Travis build resulting in "git-2.27.0_1: not found", so it tries to rebuild a bunch of stuff.
Jun 03 15:21:35 <Nilium>	Looks like it hasn't been built yet.
Jun 03 15:21:55 *	Nilium goes to rebase his fork onto a pre-git-2.27.0 commit
Jun 03 15:22:15 <ahesford>	I don't think git takes that long to build
Jun 03 15:22:41 <Nilium>	It was committed yesterday. I suspect something else is wrong.
Jun 03 15:22:57 <ericonr>	does that make a difference for CI? The void-docs CI uses what the repo would look like after rebasing a certain PR.
Jun 03 15:23:00 <Nilium>	The main problem is perl also got updated, and I'm not waiting to build perl.
Jun 03 15:23:22 <ahesford>	I noticed the git issue when rebuilding protobuf23
Jun 03 15:23:25 <Nilium>	It does, if builds are far enough behind on commits to packages that are important to multiple things
Jun 03 15:25:38 <Nilium>	x86_64 builder doesn't look like it's behind by much
Jun 03 15:28:53 <st3r4g[m]>	> travis fail because alpha.us is not synchronized

Jun 26 11:24:12 <ahesford>	I'm seeing another problem that is more annoying
Jun 26 11:24:36 <ahesford>	musl broadcasts to all configured nameservers simultaneously and accepts the first response
Jun 26 11:24:40 <duncaen>	a dns resolver that does both would be nice
Jun 26 11:25:18 <Piraty>	ahesford: musl even fails to do dns when there's an ipv6 entry in resolv.conf but kernel isn't capable of ipv6
Jun 26 11:26:01 <ahesford>	my company VPN uses a secondary, private domain for its intranet
Jun 26 11:26:08 <Piraty>	(sure, it's wrong to have an ipv6 dns in resolv.conf when ipv6 is disabled, but it's also wrong to try to resolve that and fail
Jun 26 11:26:20 <ahesford>	when I join the VPN it adds the company name servers to the top of the list
Jun 26 11:26:30 <ahesford>	this works on glibc because it will try those first and get a valid answer
Jun 26 11:26:36 <Piraty>	which vpn proto?

Jun 26 15:48:04 <ifreund>	I think cargo does caching on a per-project basis

Jun 27 21:56:22 <cinerea0>	Hey, I'm having some trouble figuring out the xbps-src patching process. Could someone help me out? I think I'm misunderstanding where files have to be placed when the patch is created or where the patch file itself has to be placed in the template directory.
Jun 27 22:05:04 <cinerea0>	I've been creating patches by placing the modified version of the file I want to patch in the wrksrc level directory, with the file I want to patch being in a lower directory. I then store the resulting patch file in a patch directory within the template directory. Is that correct?
Jun 27 22:05:09 <Skirmisher>	cinerea0: you'll have to elaborate on what you're trying to do
Jun 27 22:05:44 <Skirmisher>	in general though, you just put patches in srcpkgs/pkgname/patches/
Jun 27 22:06:04 <Skirmisher>	look at the linux packages (linux5.6 etc.) for an example
Jun 27 22:07:58 <Skirmisher>	cinerea0: wait, so what you're asking is how to *create* patches, not where to put them
Jun 27 22:09:32 <cinerea0>	Skirmisher: Okay, that means I'm putting the patches in the correct directory, that's good. And yes, I guess I'm probably creating them wrong. I keep getting a "File to patch:" error where it looks like it can't find the file.
Jun 27 22:12:15 <cinerea0>	Do the modified and original files need to be in the same directory when executing diff -u to create a successful patch?
Jun 27 22:14:34 <cinerea0>	It's also entirely possible I'm misinterpreting the error found here: https://travis-ci.org/github/void-linux/void-packages/jobs/700470845
Jun 27 22:15:01 <Skirmisher>	cinerea0: I usually use git to generate patches, if you have experience with that I would suggest using that instead
Jun 27 22:15:21 *	ericonr (~ericonr@177.194.64.215) has joined
Jun 27 22:15:22 <Skirmisher>	and again, look at other packages for examples of what the patch file should look like
Jun 27 22:22:45 <aedinius>	If its git, I do: git diff --no-prefix
Jun 27 22:23:30 <ericonr>	oh god

Jun 28 00:30:19 <ericonr>	maldridge: from the issues sgn and I were finding, due to base-files adding the `kvm` group, it needs groupadd
Jun 28 00:30:27 <ericonr>	which doesn't seem to be included there
Jun 28 00:30:45 <maldridge>	yeah, I was going for minimalism, this appears to not be as easy as I wanted
Jun 28 00:30:56 <maldridge>	if we had a functional busybox package maybe, but clearly not here
Jun 28 00:31:00 <ericonr>	you can probably noextract the `/usr/libexec/xbps-triggers/system-accounts` file
Jun 28 00:31:20 <ericonr>	I think that would fix the dependency

Jun 30 20:54:16 <ericonr>	hmm error in timezone database?
Jun 30 20:54:32 <aedinius>	shouldn't be, timezone would be wrong, not UTC
Jun 30 20:54:41 <aedinius>	flexibeast: do you use ntp?

Jun 30 20:55:13 <aedinius>	Yes
Jun 30 20:55:18 <aedinius>	Those are both UTC
Jun 30 20:55:37 <aedinius>	Some one of our clocks is wrong
Jun 30 20:56:00 <flexibeast>	Bare `date` is showing the correct time.
Jun 30 20:56:17 <ericonr>	but but 00 and 12 are the same thing in 24h and 12h format
Jun 30 20:56:17 <aedinius>	Tue 30 Jun 2020 07:56:05 PM CDT
Jun 30 20:56:22 <aedinius>	oh right
Jun 30 20:56:42 <aedinius>	My brain translated to 11:53
Jun 30 20:56:44 <aedinius>	shit.
Jun 30 20:56:45 <aedinius>	well.
Jun 30 20:56:48 <aedinius>	NEXT
Jun 30 20:56:55 <aedinius>	flexibeast: does it give a reason? ;]
Jun 30 20:57:14 <flexibeast>	Sorry, i don't understand the question .... ?
Jun 30 20:57:43 <aedinius>	Visit in firefox, does it give an error for the cert and so what?
Jun 30 20:58:14 <aedinius>	I just realized why I was confused -- US locale uses AM/PM
Jun 30 20:58:18 <aedinius>	i need a better locale
Jun 30 20:58:41 <flexibeast>	i can open https://alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org/ fine in FF.

Jun 30 20:59:22 <aedinius>	ericonr: it's what we use at work, so much easier on my brain
Jun 30 21:00:09 <flexibeast>	.... and now xbps-install isn't reporting the error.
Jun 30 21:00:20 <ericonr>	oops
Jun 30 21:00:33 <flexibeast>	i.e. it's working fine.
Jun 30 21:00:43 <ericonr>	that's weird
Jun 30 21:00:50 <ericonr>	obviously
Jun 30 21:04:25 <flexibeast>	OP is saying it's still down for them.
Jun 30 21:05:41 <ericonr>	leah2: do you have anything against including an udev rules file in openocd? They have it in the contrib folder of the tarball
Jun 30 21:06:36 <ericonr>	flexibeast: perhaps we need to wait a bit more? idk
Jun 30 21:07:19 <ericonr>	wait, their clock is wrong
Jun 30 21:07:39 <ericonr>	ask them if they dual boot windows
Jun 30 21:07:55 <ericonr>	I can't access my reddit account rn D:
Jun 30 21:08:42 <ericonr>	they are 4 hours behind, which fits for people living in aedinius's timezone
Jun 30 21:09:54 <aedinius>	no
Jun 30 21:09:55 <aedinius>	Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:09:51 -0500
Jun 30 21:10:14 <ericonr>	oof confused myself
Jun 30 21:10:42 <ericonr>	anyway, their timezone must be UTC-4
Jun 30 21:10:52 <ahesford>	that's mine
Jun 30 21:10:53 <ericonr>	then windows goes and changes the system clock to that
Jun 30 21:11:15 <ericonr>	then they probably misconfigured ntp somehow and their system isn't getting back in sync
Jun 30 21:11:21 <ahesford>	there are ways in the registry to tell win to use the system clock in UTC
Jun 30 21:11:41 <ahesford>	ntp generally refuses to adjust massive differences like that
Jun 30 21:11:50 <ericonr>	it's easier to change in linux tho
Jun 30 21:11:56 <ahesford>	no
Jun 30 21:12:06 <ahesford>	UTC sysclock is the right way
Jun 30 21:12:13 <ahesford>	make windows accomodate it
Jun 30 21:12:15 <ericonr>	well yeah
Jun 30 21:12:18 <ericonr>	but windows sucks
Jun 30 21:12:34 <ericonr>	and I can change it in linux without searching an article
Jun 30 21:12:40 <ahesford>	the fix is eminently google-able
Jun 30 21:12:54 <ericonr>	imagine no google at all tho
Jun 30 21:13:02 <ahesford>	or, for people like me, ddg-able
Jun 30 21:13:04 <ericonr>	it's definitely an ugly fix
Jun 30 21:13:16 <ericonr>	but that's the price you pay
Jun 30 21:13:18 <ahesford>	it's one registry change
Jun 30 21:13:30 <aedinius>	ahesford: that's what I did when I dual booted
Jun 30 21:13:33 <ericonr>	those windows clean up scripts should make this change too
Jun 30 21:13:44 <aedinius>	You can do it easy (set linux to localtime hwclock) or do it right (bend windows to your will)
Jun 30 21:13:49 <ericonr>	y'all are too willing to mess with the registry
Jun 30 21:13:56 <aedinius>	fuck the registry
Jun 30 21:13:59 <aedinius>	KILL IT
Jun 30 21:14:19 <ahesford>	Just run windows in qemu/kvm and don't worry about it
Jun 30 21:14:41 <ahesford>	I haven't dual-booted since 1999
Jun 30 21:14:42 <ericonr>	does qemu detect the host and perform the proper translation?
Jun 30 21:14:50 <ericonr>	or do you just run windows with an offset?
Jun 30 21:15:19 <ericonr>	also the third option of qemu/libvirt having a pretty option to set it
Jun 30 21:15:19 <ahesford>	ericonr: I think you can configure it; there's seomething in the libvirt XML
Jun 30 21:16:07 <ahesford>	so, in other words, the last time I dual booted, ericonr sprung forth from his mother's womb
Jun 30 21:17:02 <ericonr>	did you even have them fancy virtualization technologies back then?
Jun 30 21:17:40 <aedinius>	my guess is they have /etc/localtime set to UTC and just set the clock to their timezone
Jun 30 21:17:43 <aedinius>	unofficial theory
Jun 30 21:18:14 <ahesford>	no fancy svm or vt-x back then
Jun 30 21:18:16 <ericonr>	they said they checked timezone, though. I blame windows-linux relations
Jun 30 21:18:33 <ahesford>	just good old BIOS and two partitons on MBR

Jun 30 21:21:52 <ahesford>	there was elilo for EFI, but I had my head elsewhere then
Jun 30 21:21:53 <ericonr>	we should redirect SSL errors in void docs to the Time and Date page
Jun 30 21:21:57 <ericonr>	in http://
Jun 30 21:22:29 <ericonr>	is this even doable?
Jun 30 21:22:45 <ericonr>	I kind of want it now
Jun 30 21:22:53 <ahesford>	dunno, I'm not much of a web guy
Jun 30 21:24:14 <ericonr>	aedinius: can you link them to the handbook page, please?
Jun 30 21:24:32 <ericonr>	they are trying to go about solving it the wrong way
Jun 30 21:24:55 <cinerea0>	Anyone know what standard procedure is for packaging software that draws in dependencies via git submodules?
Jun 30 21:25:19 <ericonr>	usually a bunch of distfiles
Jun 30 21:27:08 <cinerea0>	Gotcha. Is it then a situation where it would be acceptable to draw in non-release git versions of those dependencies?
Jun 30 21:28:15 <ericonr>	yes, you should find out what commits were being used when the main application got a release
Jun 30 21:30:16 <fossy>	pretty easy to git checkout the version and to list the submodules
Jun 30 21:30:30 <ifreund>	welp, i have no idea why QT can't find the modules when cross compiling, I did add qt5-host-tools to the hostmakedepends
Jun 30 21:30:38 <aedinius>	ericonr: They're not far off
Jun 30 21:30:48 <aedinius>	ericonr: Just need to pick a timezone in Canada, not Canada itself.
Jun 30 21:30:50 <ifreund>	probably just need to go to sleep and look again in the morning
Jun 30 21:31:09 <aedinius>	"What timezone are you?" "Oh, Canada."
Jun 30 21:31:13 <aedinius>	Not even if flipped on its side
Jun 30 21:32:13 <ericonr>	ifreund: if you don't want to sleep yet, some packages have makedepends in hostmakedepends for cross
Jun 30 21:32:27 <ericonr>	aedinius: lol
Jun 30 21:33:28 <ifreund>	ericonr: got an example?
Jun 30 21:34:40 <ifreund>	huh, looks like that made it work for aarch64 cross at least
Jun 30 21:35:18 <ifreund>	spoke too soon, it failed at linking
Jun 30 21:35:27 <ericonr>	ifreund: it went by the void feed recently
Jun 30 21:36:21 <ericonr>	I can't find it now
Jun 30 21:41:22 <ahesford>	ifreund: hikari uses wayland-devel in both *makedepends for cross
Jun 30 21:41:41 <ahesford>	because the host has to run wayland-scanner
Jun 30 21:42:02 <ahesford>	my scipy fix uses python-numpy
Jun 30 21:42:24 <ahesford>	...in both because setup.py fails on the host if it is missing
Jun 30 21:42:44 <ahesford>	but then I have to jump throuhh hoops to use the target headers and libs

Jun 30 23:25:23 <ericonr>	with multiple distfiles you should use create_wrksrc=yes, and move files around in post_extract()
Jun 30 23:26:27 <ericonr>	try to run `./xbps-src extract <package>` to see what the file layout is looking like
Jun 30 23:27:19 <ericonr>	and with create_wrksrc you will probably need to set build_wrksrc=<folder-main-tarball-was-decompressed-into>

Jul 04 23:07:29 <q66>	?
Jul 04 23:09:39 <cinerea0>	There's something I want to package, but a vital commit occurred after the last official release. The dev hasn't made any commits to the project in 3 months, and hasn't been active on GitHub at all in a month. I opened an issue in the repo a few days ago asking about a new release including that vital commit I mentioned before.
Jul 04 23:14:38 <ahesford>	However long you think to wait, wait three months longer
Jul 04 23:14:50 <q66>	i see
Jul 04 23:14:57 <q66>	well i don't think there's any specific time
Jul 04 23:15:02 <q66>	it depends on the person managing the project
Jul 04 23:15:03 <ahesford>	By induction, just wait forever
Jul 04 23:15:52 <ahesford>	What is the vital commit?
Jul 04 23:16:43 <ahesford>	You can always just add a patch to your package. I doubt anybody will complain if you note that the patch is already upstream and you are just waiting for a release
Jul 04 23:17:47 <cinerea0>	>By induction, just wait forever
Jul 04 23:17:57 <cinerea0>	lol, that actually made me chuckle
Jul 04 23:18:26 <cinerea0>	The commit adds proper PAM support to the project, which is a display manager.
Jul 04 23:18:54 <ericonr>	cinerea0: I feel like that's Ly
Jul 04 23:18:57 <ericonr>	is it Ly?
Jul 04 23:20:29 <cinerea0>	ericonr: It's Ly. I found a fork of the project that included the proper runit service files, changed them to use tty7, and it works.
Jul 04 23:20:56 <ericonr>	nice
Jul 04 23:21:11 <ericonr>	one of the oldest open PRs are for Ly
Jul 04 23:21:37 <ericonr>	https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/pull/13649
Jul 04 23:21:46 <ericonr>	s/are/is/
Jul 04 23:23:11 <ericonr>	the author of Ly works in bursts. they come in every once in a while, accept PRs and close issues, then release a new version and vanish for a bit
Jul 04 23:23:33 <ericonr>	I managed to get 2 PRs in the middle of all that though
Jul 04 23:23:55 <cinerea0>	Oh yeah, I saw you in the contributor's list.
Jul 04 23:25:25 *	Socke has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Jul 04 23:25:49 <ericonr>	but yeah, if you want to add the patch for now it should be fine. I have a WIP I was making too https://github.com/ericonr/void-packages/tree/ly-0.5.0
Jul 04 23:26:02 <ericonr>	never put the patch in though
Jul 04 23:26:36 *	Socke (~socke@dslb-188-096-137-084.188.096.pools.vodafone-ip.de) has joined
Jul 04 23:28:22 <cinerea0>	Ok, so I think I'm going to continue working on my currently open PR. When I'm finished with that, I'll check back in on Ly and see if a new version has been pushed. If not, I'll make the package using 0.5.0 and bring it up to speed using patches.
Jul 04 23:28:38 <cinerea0>	Adding in all those distfiles sure is a pain in the ass, huh?
Jul 04 23:29:44 <ericonr>	heh, that's what we get with submodules
Jul 04 23:32:36 <cinerea0>	ericonr: For some reason that reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you, what's the deal with that crocodile in your GitHub profile pic?
Jul 04 23:34:54 <ericonr>	heh, just a photo I took on vacation once and ended up deciding to use as online identity
Jul 04 23:35:21 <ericonr>	I just really liked the pic :p
Jul 04 23:36:42 <cinerea0>	It is a very dapper croc, so I understand.
Jul 04 23:37:17 <ericonr>	:)
Jul 04 23:41:26 <maldridge>	well, I now have my desktop and one of void's servers talking via a VPN link
Jul 04 23:41:38 <ericonr>	btw, can I open a PR to update musl to 1.2.0 so we can track discussion there?
Jul 04 23:42:56 <maldridge>	feel free
Jul 04 23:43:01 <maldridge>	though I think it is not on the immediate horizon
Jul 04 23:43:24 <ericonr>	fair enough
Jul 04 23:43:44 <ericonr>	I will daily drive it and see if I spot any issues
Jul 04 23:44:00 <ericonr>	though it will likely be subtle breakage, but oh well
Jul 04 23:47:35 <maldridge>	its likely very subtle breakage, and the problem is that updating the C library like that is going to be a universe rebuild
Jul 04 23:53:34 <ericonr>	yeah
Jul 04 23:54:00 <ericonr>	and from the conversation I've seen on #musl, it seems like PHP isn't solved yet
Jul 04 23:54:11 <ericonr>	or at least it required some specific configuration
Jul 04 23:55:15 <ericonr>	I will do a proper reading of https://musl.libc.org/time64.html and all the associated links before making a PR
Jul 04 23:56:56 <ericonr>	we might need to update kernel-libc-headers as well, if I understand the issue correctly
Jul 05 00:01:06 <maldridge>	total aside, even if you're not american or have interest in US history, the musical Hamilton is on Disney+ and its some of the best musical theatre I've ever seen filmed.  still not quite as good as live performance, but well worth watching
Jul 05 00:04:48 <ericonr>	maldridge: you probably have some pull with disney, can you ask them about when Disney+ is going to be made available here?
Jul 05 00:07:24 *	b has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
Jul 05 00:11:10 <maldridge>	south america or Brazil in general?
Jul 05 00:11:22 <maldridge>	Brazil has some funky rules around data residency, that's why Google has a DC there
Jul 05 00:19:25 <ericonr>	hmm idk about the rest of SA
Jul 05 00:19:40 <ericonr>	but here in Brazil it just asks for my email so they can send me news about the service :p
Jul 05 00:20:57 <maldridge>	well, if you're in a major city or near a pop for a major network, you could always just VPN to the US
Jul 05 00:31:17 <ericonr>	using a VPN to browse to a paid service in another country feels like half-assing illegality
Jul 05 00:31:41 <ericonr>	I might download it somehow or wait for it to land here some other way, because it does seem like a good watch
Jul 05 00:31:44 <ericonr>	thanks for the rec c:
Jul 05 00:35:43 <maldridge>	meh
