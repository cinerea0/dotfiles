Apr 21 19:02:32 <nbm>	dhcpcd-eth0 is specific to the only ethernet port i guess?
Apr 21 19:02:49 <nbm>	is it fine to use that server instead of /etc/sv/dhcpcd ?
Apr 21 19:02:53 <nbm>	service*
Apr 21 19:03:21 <aedinius>	So its specific to eth0
Apr 21 19:03:58 <aedinius>	If your ethernet is not eth0 (on many of my systems it is not)
Apr 21 19:04:03 <aedinius>	Then it won't work.
Apr 21 19:04:31 <aedinius>	/etc/sv/dhcpcd on the other hand, runs in "master" mode iirc, and will manage any (and all) interface it can
Apr 21 19:04:35 <nbm>	cool

Apr 21 19:34:24 <moorecott>	is voidlinux superior to arch?
Apr 21 19:35:08 <haydenh>	imo, yes, but your mileage may vary
Apr 21 19:35:52 <ahesford>	when I got back into open-source *nix, I used arch for about a year
Apr 21 19:36:24 <ahesford>	Not too bad
Apr 21 19:36:39 <ahesford>	But Void was the first thing to get me excited about things since FreeBSD in 2001
Apr 21 19:36:54 <flexibeast>	Surely it depends on one's use-case. :-)
Apr 21 19:37:33 <ahesford>	I value lightweight installations that are easy to manage and configure
Apr 21 19:37:38 <ahesford>	Void fits that bill
Apr 21 19:37:42 <flexibeast>	+1
Apr 21 19:37:57 <ahesford>	Arch isn't bad either, but systemd is harder to manage
Apr 21 19:38:22 <moorecott>	what about Artix (it uses s6, openrc, or runit)?
Apr 21 19:38:29 <hechos>	sorry ahesford but systemd make complicated a simple task to do...
Apr 21 19:38:50 <ahesford>	although my migration to void cost me about a day of porting some systemd file-path targets to inotify-based scripts, but in the end it's easier to sling around the scripts
Apr 21 19:38:50 <hechos>	artix openrc
Apr 21 19:39:50 <hechos>	ahesford: runit is more close to unix philosophy
Apr 21 19:40:00 <hechos>	in my opinion.
Apr 21 19:40:06 <ahesford>	hechos: I agree
Apr 21 19:40:17 <ahesford>	I think you misread my comment
Apr 21 19:40:44 <hechos>	more or less, is choice of taste but runit is far faster
Apr 21 19:41:02 <hechos>	ahesford: i read harded to manage.
Apr 21 19:41:26 <hechos>	ahesford: maybe is my elegant indian english, aka sudaka spanish.
Apr 21 19:41:30 <hechos>	lol
Apr 21 19:41:40 <ahesford>	I think systemd is harder to manage than runit scripts
Apr 21 19:42:24 <hadet>	I personally have never really like OpenRC it's slow and cumbersome. I'm not a big person in the init debate anyway, I've seen systemd for it's good and most bad things since i've been working with it. It's good to have alternatives, and I believe SystemD is far moe than a desktop distro needs for a init system
Apr 21 19:43:22 <hechos>	hadet: dream maybe is alpine + runit
Apr 21 19:43:31 <bougyman>	heh. I think systemd's goals and ideals are all about making a desktop a regular user can manage safely.
Apr 21 19:43:34 <hechos>	hadet: but void + runit is great!
Apr 21 19:43:38 <hadet>	Oh absolutely
Apr 21 19:44:03 <hadet>	Void is probably the best desktop experience I've ever had on Linux and i've been suing linux since 1999 or so.
Apr 21 19:44:08 <bougyman>	i don't really mind systemd on my work desktop much. I just disable the ugly parts.
Apr 21 19:44:22 <ahesford>	hadet: you shouldn't sue linux
Apr 21 19:44:24 <ahesford>	;)
Apr 21 19:44:27 <hadet>	lol
Apr 21 19:44:37 <hadet>	Sorry i'm going on a 4 day migraine now
Apr 21 19:44:40 <ahesford>	that's microsoft's job
Apr 21 19:44:41 <hechos>	hadet: for me is the best for now. many years of computer use, and the problem is my!
Apr 21 19:44:50 <hechos>	my = me
Apr 21 19:46:02 <hadet>	I still mostly use Debian and Ubuntu at work, it's honestly painful sometimes, especially offering support for devs that are just getting out of college and college kids themselves.
Apr 21 19:46:36 <hadet>	When I was working at Amazon it was Amazon Linux which is essentially CentOS but still systemd
Apr 21 19:46:47 <ahesford>	I've installed a few Ubuntu systems, but I don't like to
Apr 21 19:46:55 <bougyman>	wut?
Apr 21 19:46:58 <ahesford>	I built a cluster on CentOS 6, then updated it to CentoS 7
Apr 21 19:47:08 <bougyman>	our internal amazon linux was still upstart.
Apr 21 19:47:14 <bougyman>	did they finally get apollo to support al2?
Apr 21 19:47:18 <hechos>	ubuntu is oriented to end-user.
Apr 21 19:47:21 <hadet>	I think so.
Apr 21 19:47:29 <bougyman>	I left in Sept, 2019, we were still on 2012.4
Apr 21 19:47:35 <hechos>	looks like home-user or desktop usage.

Apr 21 19:47:54 <hechos>	depens on what scenario.
Apr 21 19:47:55 <aedinius>	) I recently installed a debian derivative on my "training course" drive, and void is much more reliable so far =/
Apr 21 19:47:56 <hadet>	bougyman: no wait you're right

Apr 21 19:48:47 <hadet>	The problem with Debian is honestly you eventually get to a point where you're either enabling t a PPA or compiling from source.
Apr 21 19:48:56 <aedinius>	Debian doesn't have PPAs
Apr 21 19:49:19 <hadet>	Sorry secondary repo
Apr 21 19:49:23 <ahesford>	The last time I used proper Debian was 1999-2000
Apr 21 19:49:27 <hechos>	aedinius: yes PPA is ubuntu guys.
Apr 21 19:49:32 <ahesford>	I have Raspbian on my Pi3
Apr 21 19:49:44 <hadet>	Yeah my bad, my wording could have been a little better
Apr 21 19:49:46 <ahesford>	Well... RetroPie
Apr 21 19:49:50 <hadet>	I meant adding another source.
Apr 21 19:50:22 <hechos>	BSD on RPI looks nice.
Apr 21 19:50:42 <hadet>	I did NetBSD on mine for a bit. It was pretty nice
Apr 21 19:50:45 <ahesford>	I only use it to play some emulated games, haven't had the interest in really hacking on it
Apr 21 19:50:46 <aedinius>	Last time I ran debian proper was my gaming desktop a while back, was using debian/testing and it worked quite well. then moved it to void.
Apr 21 19:51:15 <aedinius>	I think the issues I was having with the debian-ish install on my laptop was the CSM bios thing I had enabled when trying to get my old install to work
Apr 21 19:51:35 <aedinius>	The drive was for another laptop that died.
Apr 21 19:51:51 <aedinius>	I ended up just reinstalling.
Apr 21 19:51:52 <hadet>	I've been trying to get my brother to switch to debian testing instead of running Ubuntu but he's just too comfortable
Apr 21 19:52:07 <aedinius>	Wife runs Ubuntu right now
Apr 21 19:52:12 <hadet>	I had to walk him through fixing a PPA making his system unable to update a couple weeks ago though
Apr 21 19:52:35 <aedinius>	When the release she's on hits EOL I'm either going to let her make her own path or I'm going to help her replace it with debian/stable
Apr 21 19:52:40 <hadet>	He had installed some runescape PPA and it somehow messed up some library stuff with upgrading the nvidia package
Apr 21 19:53:33 <hadet>	Had to manually delete the sources list for the PPA, then fulling remove and purge nvidia, then reinstall 435.
Apr 21 19:53:49 <hadet>	He's technically EOL now which is why i'm trying to get him to switch
Apr 21 19:54:15 <hadet>	Just really need to backup his steam games and documents
Apr 21 19:54:25 <johnnywho>	The only thing I miss from source distros is having the headers around for every library by default
Apr 21 19:54:42 <johnnywho>	I 'll find a way to auto-install all devel packages of any dep
Apr 21 19:54:57 <aedinius>	That's not a source distro thing, that happens with binary distros as well
Apr 21 19:55:08 <aedinius>	Just not void.
Apr 21 19:55:10 <aedinius>	Arch does it.
Apr 21 19:55:17 <aedinius>	Why do I need -devel packages unless I need them?
Apr 21 19:55:36 <johnnywho>	I understand the separation
Apr 21 19:55:39 <johnnywho>	it 's neat
Apr 21 19:55:52 <johnnywho>	I just want a way to overcome it
Apr 21 19:56:17 <aedinius>	Unless its a personal project, I rarely build anything outside of xbps-src
Apr 21 19:56:23 <hadet>	Yeah I'm really not sure why Arch does that.
Apr 21 19:56:34 <johnnywho>	Well they don 't take much space
Apr 21 19:56:41 <johnnywho>	just some text files
Apr 21 19:56:59 <hadet>	I'll say one thing I really do not miss running Gentoo on my desktop
Apr 21 19:57:20 <johnnywho>	compiling libreoffice lol
Apr 21 19:57:32 <hadet>	Or gnome
Apr 21 19:57:43 <ahesford>	johnnywho: what if you have multiple versioned libraries, like libprotobuf?
Apr 21 19:57:52 <ahesford>	who gets to install the libprotobuf.so link?
Apr 21 19:57:59 <hadet>	I ran Gentoo on a Pentium 4 and then Athlon FX-51 though
Apr 21 19:58:03 <ahesford>	having separate -devel packages helps avoid that
Apr 21 19:58:12 <johnnywho>	ahesford: yes, that 's a problem
Apr 21 19:58:20 <johnnywho>	Source distros use slotting
Apr 21 19:58:28 <johnnywho>	or something like that
Apr 21 19:58:40 <aedinius>	I ran Gentoo on a P3/700
Apr 21 19:58:43 <ahesford>	Besides, some header collections can be huge
Apr 21 19:58:51 <aedinius>	Before it died because I killed the PSU
Apr 21 19:58:52 <ahesford>	it's nice not to install those if you don't need them
Apr 21 19:59:01 <johnnywho>	I guess I could just make metapackages for those I need
Apr 21 19:59:16 <aedinius>	It was a little HP Pavilion that I loaded up with a nice GPU (at the time), a SCSI card, and a few SCSI drives
Apr 21 19:59:31 <johnnywho>	or I could write a script that makes a metapackage for the devel of dependencies of a said package
Apr 21 20:00:04 <Johnnynator>	You can just run a cronjob that runs `xbps-install -Suy $(xnodev)` to get all the devel packages all the time.
Apr 21 20:00:05 <aedinius>	I just install -devel when I need it

Apr 21 20:01:36 <johnnywho>	I notice that xbps is really well documented
Apr 21 20:01:39 <Johnnynator>	But I tend to usually mark -devel and -dbg packages always as automatic installed (install them with xbps-install -A). So I can just remove them with xbps-remove -Oo
Apr 21 20:02:00 <johnnywho>	that sounds like a good idea
Apr 21 20:02:05 <aedinius>	-dbg packages don't update well for me, so I end up removing them all the time
Apr 21 20:02:09 <aedinius>	Not sure why its a thing, but it is
Apr 21 20:02:40 <Johnnynator>	Never had an issue with -dbg packages updating.
Apr 21 20:02:50 <johnnywho>	Johnnynator: otherwise you would need to keep a list of the devel files and then update this list when you remove them
Apr 21 20:02:51 <Johnnynator>	They are just mostly a waste of diskpace.
Apr 21 20:03:08 <aedinius>	Unless you need to debug something
Apr 21 20:03:16 <johnnywho>	dbg is neat for big stuff
Apr 21 20:03:39 <Johnnynator>	aedinius: Yeah, kinda what I wanted to say :).

There's a tool from a language binding that's required for the build process, but the language binding doesn't meet the requirements for packaging (no releases). Is there any way to `go get` a tool during the build process using the template?
Jun 03 14:06:30 <ericonr>	cinerea0: you can do something in pre_fetch or post_fetch

Jun 03 16:23:00 <TheJollyRoger>	Hi guys. I just installed Void on my laptop with full disk encryption. The kernel boots and I can get to a shell and browse the filesystem, but at this moment I'm kinda screwed since there's no networking. I'm going to chroot back into the live environment, is there some package list that would get me the list of packages and configuration files somewhere to get an install similar to the live
Jun 03 16:23:03 <TheJollyRoger>	environment? Since wireless was working in the live environment.
Jun 03 16:24:04 <amom>	TheJollyRoger: did you do a minimal install?
Jun 03 16:24:25 <amom>	If you did, you must configure wpa_supplicant
Jun 03 16:24:37 <TheJollyRoger>	Hi! Yeah, I just installed base-system, cryptsetup, grub, and lvm2. And vi.
Jun 03 16:24:53 <amom>	TheJollyRoger: https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/network/wpa_supplicant.html?highlight=wpa#wpa_supplicant
Jun 03 16:25:12 <TheJollyRoger>	I didn't install using the install wizard but rather installed using a chroot, so I'm just wondering if there's a list of stuff I could get somewhere that has the entire thing-- AH!
Jun 03 16:25:14 <TheJollyRoger>	Okay great, thanks!
Jun 03 16:26:04 <ericonr>	I have a list of packages I have installed, but that's likely not going to help you :p
Jun 03 16:26:37 <ericonr>	most Desktop Environnments have meta packages if you want a similar environment to the live system
Jun 03 16:26:41 <TheJollyRoger>	Ah, cripes. Looks like I might have to just try and figure this out for myself then :(
Jun 03 16:26:44 <TheJollyRoger>	Oh excellent!
Jun 03 16:27:00 <ericonr>	What are you looking to have?
Jun 03 16:27:50 <TheJollyRoger>	I think the only thing I need that the live environment didn't have is weechat, TexStudio, and LibreOffice, probably? That's about it.
Jun 03 16:28:16 <TheJollyRoger>	I just wanted to install with FDE so that's why I tried installing with a chroot rather than simply use the install wizard.
Jun 03 16:28:46 <TheJollyRoger>	Since I take my laptop with me everywhere and I have a nasty tendency to lose things or like, there's the risk of me accidentally leaving my bag on the bus.
Jun 03 16:28:57 <ericonr>	got it!
Jun 03 16:29:16 <TheJollyRoger>	Like, I was surprised to find that the live environment even supported the touchscreen and wireless right out of the box.
Jun 03 16:29:18 <TheJollyRoger>	Clean as a whistle!
Jun 03 16:29:22 <TheJollyRoger>	Easy as winking!

Jun 03 16:50:05 <TheJollyRoger>	The LiveCD environment works, I just don't have that working for the installed system juuuust yet.
Jun 03 16:50:11 <TheJollyRoger>	So I'll do that to make sure...
Jun 03 16:50:39 <TheJollyRoger>	What display manager would you guys recommend for xfce4? I'm planning to use lxdm.

Jun 03 16:55:43 <TheJollyRoger>	Ha, well... this is gonna be for my laptop, so I kind of want to try to make it as conventional as possible, not trying to win nerd credit with it :(
Jun 03 16:56:21 <hadet>	TheJollyRoger: I use Gnome because it's what i'm most comfortable with having worked with CentOS, Redhat and Debian workstations for so long. My laptops i use Herbsluftwm though.
Jun 03 16:57:11 <ericonr>	TheJollyRoger: I don't have the patience to set up a display manager, actually :p
Jun 03 16:57:27 <TheJollyRoger>	Aw crap. Looks like when I try to boot the installed system it won't fully boot. I can get a shell but if I try to do "shutdown -P now" I get "- runit: warning: signals only work in stage 2"
Jun 03 16:57:38 <ericonr>	and my current Sway setup needs to be started from the terminal too, at least for now
Jun 03 16:57:47 <TheJollyRoger>	System seems to be booting in single user mode. Anyone have any idea what's going on here?
Jun 03 16:57:53 <sth_>	TheJollyRoger: i know it's not maintained but i still relaly like SLiM
Jun 03 16:58:06 <sth_>	really*
Jun 03 16:58:17 <sth_>	it works fine
Jun 03 16:58:25 <sth_>	and it's really easy to make your own 'themes'
Jun 03 16:58:50 <TheJollyRoger>	Hey that part appeals to me.
Jun 03 16:59:18 <sth_>	its literally like 3 parts. background image, 'panel' image and positioning via config file
Jun 03 16:59:37 <TheJollyRoger>	Hmm. Anyone have any ideas what this could be with runit refusing to shut down the computer, and not booting fully into a complete system?
Jun 03 16:59:41 <TheJollyRoger>	It's mounting the root file system.
Jun 03 16:59:54 <ericonr>	it should give you some sort of error message
Jun 03 17:00:09 <ericonr>	and you're probably in the dracut emergency shell
Jun 03 17:00:32 <ericonr>	if root is mounted, you might be able to exit the shell and the system will work
Jun 03 17:00:46 <TheJollyRoger>	Let's see if I --
Jun 03 17:00:48 <TheJollyRoger>	oh wow.
Jun 03 17:00:49 <ericonr>	or not, then you hame something to fix in the shell before the system can boot
Jun 03 17:00:50 <TheJollyRoger>	That did it.
Jun 03 17:00:53 <TheJollyRoger>	LXDM came up.
Jun 03 17:01:17 <ericonr>	there should be a /shutdown program or similar to allow you to shutdown, iirc
Jun 03 17:01:31 <ericonr>	haven't navigated rescue in a while
Jun 03 17:01:49 <ericonr>	^ that's in the emergency shell
Jun 03 17:02:10 <TheJollyRoger>	Got it. Is there a way to skip the emergency shell then
Jun 03 17:02:28 <TheJollyRoger>	I just have to shut it down one more time because it seems lxdm won't accept the password, so I have to chroot back and change the password.
Jun 03 17:03:05 <TheJollyRoger>	Let me go and see if I can change keys.
Jun 03 17:03:36 <ericonr>	solve the problem that's causing it to appear :p
Jun 03 17:03:53 <ericonr>	I think you can configure what it does for emergency shell too
Jun 03 17:04:03 <TheJollyRoger>	Okay, I'll go and see what I can do...
Jun 03 17:04:20 <TheJollyRoger>	OK I think I got it, it was a malformed entry in my etc fstab
Jun 03 17:04:23 <ericonr>	take a look at dracut.cmdline(7)
Jun 03 17:04:32 <ericonr>	brb
Jun 03 17:04:39 <TheJollyRoger>	Got it. I think it's fixed now.
Jun 03 17:04:46 <TheJollyRoger>	I'm going to chroot one last time so I can fix the password issue.
Jun 03 17:05:26 <bytesafari>	Does the base install image (not one of the DE images) use GNOME as the default DE?

Jun 03 17:29:49 <Rmccask>	Is there someone online who could help explain why the builds are failing.  I am looking at the arm6l log and it tried to build arc-theme.  Somehow it is trying to pull in the old libcryptsetup package (it should be building a new one) and that is trying to include the old libjson so file (that it is supposed to be rebuilding).  I don't know where libcryptstup is being pulled in.
Jun 03 17:31:06 <Rmccask>	I am the one with the pr for json-c.  I have not been able to reproduce the build problem locally.
Jun 03 17:31:14 <steinex>	seems like traving is using a mirror that is out-of-sync, there is little you can do right now.
Jun 03 17:31:41 <steinex>	travis, actually
Jun 03 17:31:47 <Rmccask>	Ok.  I guess I need to think 4th dimensionally then.  Thanks!
Jun 03 17:32:00 <zdykstra>	now you're thinking with portals

Jun 03 17:32:50 <TheJollyRoger>	There we go. Still need to figure out how to get luks to recognize the proper keymap, but I can type in QWERTY well enough. Looks like it's working, now all I gotta do is get rid of that policykit error when xfce4 starts - a minor annoyance, but looks like the system's working with wireless and everything! That was awesome, thanks guys!
Jun 03 17:33:21 <Johnnynator>	Since it fails on installin a host dep, which sooner or later will be built there.
Jun 03 17:33:40 <zdykstra>	TheJollyRoger: running on your ppc64le box, or on x86?

Jun 03 17:34:07 <Rmccask>	x86_64 must just finished so maybe the logjam will start to clear.

Jun 09 19:43:33 <hadet>	Haha i use XFS on one of my laptops
Jun 09 19:43:59 <aedinius>	I have it on most everything, except a few things that were never migrated from JFS
Jun 09 19:44:18 <hadet>	I use a btrfs root though, it's got good compression and it also Copy on Write
Jun 09 19:44:32 <hadet>	For most of my machines anyway
Jun 09 19:44:59 <hadet>	ZFS is great though don't get me wrong
Jun 09 19:45:03 <ericonr>	ZFS is still missing btrfs's cp --reflink :c
Jun 09 19:45:12 <hadet>	^
Jun 09 19:47:04 <Nilium>	I think I used XFS back when it was new in Slackware

Jun 09 19:48:22 <aedinius>	I used JFS until work upgraded to RHEL7 which meant we had XFS as default and so I started migrating all of my stuff to it.
Jun 09 19:49:23 <Nilium>	I started setting up a virtual workstation on my Proxmox cluster so would stop needing to SSH into my laptop to do Void things
Jun 09 19:49:31 <Nilium>	That one's currently using ZFS
Jun 09 19:49:39 <Nilium>	ZFS on top of ZFS
Jun 09 19:49:45 <Nilium>	It's ZFS all the way down.

Jun 09 19:57:01 <pinpox>	Hi, trying to lauch xmonad. I have SDDM installed and currently running i3 but there is no option to select xmonad in the login manager even though I installed the xmonad and xmonad-contrib packages
Jun 09 19:58:26 <aedinius>	xmonad doesn't have a .desktop xsession file
Jun 09 19:58:33 <ericonr>	cameronnemo: seems like xmonad-contrib is another package that's just a license
Jun 09 19:58:56 <pinpox>	aedinius: So the easiest is to just create one?
Jun 09 19:59:19 <aedinius>	https://wiki.haskell.org/Xmonad/Frequently_asked_questions search for xmonad.desktop
Jun 09 19:59:27 <pinpox>	aedinius: I'm trying out xmonad and would like to keep the option to switch easily to i3 until I'm comfortable

Jun 09 20:06:29 <ni638629>	Hello
Jun 09 20:06:34 <ni638629>	I am sisungo
Jun 09 20:07:00 <ni638629>	How to manual install?
Jun 09 20:07:06 <ni638629>	Without installer?
Jun 09 20:07:18 <ni638629>	And what is a RootFS tarball?
Jun 09 20:07:42 <pinpox>	aedinius: Sorry if thats a noob question, but it wont read any changes in .xmonad/xmonad.hs, is the default config path for xmonad different in void?
Jun 09 20:07:59 <aedinius>	pinpox: That I'm not sure

Jun 09 20:08:39 <pinpox>	Can't find any newer article in the docs
Jun 09 20:08:50 *	sisungo (~sisungo@117.136.7.239) has joined
Jun 09 20:08:59 <sisungo>	My nickname is set.
Jun 09 20:09:10 <sisungo>	How to manual install without installer?
Jun 09 20:09:28 <sisungo>	The installer is a script, so I can change filesystems.
Jun 09 20:09:46 <sisungo>	But how to make it install to x86_64-musl?
Jun 09 20:10:46 <sisungo>	I like ZFS and Musl.
Jun 09 20:11:04 <sisungo>	And how can I install them in ONE system?
Jun 09 20:11:56 *	superdoc (~superdoct@64.44.55.204) has joined
Jun 09 20:11:59 <ericonr>	the easiest way to install a musl system with the live image installer is with a musl image
Jun 09 20:12:30 <sisungo>	Yes, I am using the musl image.
Jun 09 20:12:41 <sisungo>	But I want to use Root on ZFS
Jun 09 20:12:51 <sisungo>	Modprobe returns not found
Jun 09 20:12:57 <zdykstra>	https://github.com/zdykstra/zfsbootmenu/wiki
Jun 09 20:13:02 <sisungo>	How to modprobe zfs?
Jun 09 20:13:15 <zdykstra>	there are relatively easy to follow step-by-step directions there for root on ZFS
Jun 09 20:13:50 <hadet>	Maybe i should work on a ZFS root install guide for the Docs
Jun 09 20:14:09 <sisungo>	thanks, and the zfs package may have bugs.
Jun 09 20:14:14 <hadet>	Yes
Jun 09 20:14:27 <ericonr>	hadet: there's an in progress PR for that
Jun 09 20:15:32 <hadet>	Oh i should have checked
Jun 09 20:15:34 <ericonr>	anyone here with an HP printer? in my raspbian days CUPS automatically loaded the foo2xqx driver for me, on Void I can't get it to work
Jun 09 20:15:45 *	_barcode_ (~bc@14.81-167-76.customer.lyse.net) has joined
Jun 09 20:15:48 <ahesford>	I have an HP Envy 4520 inkjet and a LaserJet 1320
Jun 09 20:16:02 <ericonr>	hadet: you are welcome to comment on it c:
Jun 09 20:16:52 <ahesford>	ericonr: how are you attempting to get the printer working
Jun 09 20:17:34 <hadet>	CUPS is automatically detecting my printer, which is an inkjet
Jun 09 20:17:37 <hadet>	weird
Jun 09 20:17:42 <ericonr>	ahesford: install all the foomatic-db packages, install CUPS, enable the cupsd service, and try to configure through the web interface
Jun 09 20:18:22 <ericonr>	it's a laserjet M1120 MFP
Jun 09 20:19:02 <ericonr>	I think it's getting the same error I got last time I tried, where the perl script that parses profiles takes too long and timeouts
Jun 09 20:19:18 <ericonr>	at least that's what I understood as the potential issue
Jun 09 20:19:23 <sisungo>	Why “wine“‘s 64-bit support on musl is limited!
Jun 09 20:19:26 <sisungo>	?
Jun 09 20:20:06 <ericonr>	because we don't have musl multilib
Jun 09 20:20:25 <ericonr>	unless I misunderstood your question
Jun 09 20:21:03 <ahesford>	ericonr: I am using the hpcups driver for my laserjet 1320 and hpijs for my envy 4520. I think both come from hplip
Jun 09 20:21:31 <ahesford>	I don't use any of the tools with hplip, just configure cups directly
Jun 09 20:21:58 <sisungo>	Is musl i386 or amd64 or both?
Jun 09 20:22:10 <ahesford>	hplip also gives me scanner access on the envy 4520, if you enable the hpaio sane backend
Jun 09 20:22:13 <sisungo>	Only select one?
Jun 09 20:22:51 <ericonr>	ahesford: I have scanner access with sane without any other package, for some reason
Jun 09 20:23:03 <ahesford>	it's probably using a different backend that is automatically enabled
Jun 09 20:23:22 <ericonr>	are the hplip plugins binaries? I'm trying it on the Pi
Jun 09 20:23:49 <ahesford>	the template lists no archs
Jun 09 20:24:58 <ahesford>	I miss the good old LPR and LPRng days
Jun 09 20:25:06 <aedinius>	sisungo: musl is only amd64
Jun 09 20:25:39 <ericonr>	ahesford: ok, I'm gonna try them again
Jun 09 20:25:54 <ericonr>	do you need to run any hplip commands or does cup do the whole thing for you?
Jun 09 20:25:57 <aedinius>	sisungo: you can build stuff for i686-musl yourself, but it's not an official build
Jun 09 20:26:32 <ahesford>	ericonr: I just configure through cups like normal, but select the driver provided by hplip. the hplip utilities never seem to work right for me
Jun 09 20:26:34 <sisungo>	Well, only amd64.
Jun 09 20:26:46 <sisungo>	But why wine on musl is only i386?
Jun 09 20:27:01 <aedinius>	It had issues
Jun 09 20:27:21 <aedinius>	It used to only be i686 glibc
Jun 09 20:27:39 <ericonr>	ahesford: cool, thanks. I might uninstall foomatic completely if the script timeouts again
Jun 09 20:27:54 <ahesford>	I have foomatic-db installed

Jun 09 20:48:04 <aedinius>	I should fix this.
Jun 09 20:48:11 <ahesford>	looks like foo2xqx is the only way to go
Jun 09 20:48:47 <ericonr>	ahesford: I will try to follow the "CUPS" instructions there
Jun 09 20:49:45 <sisungo>	I think xbps should configure ZFS kernel module.
Jun 09 20:50:01 <ahesford>	sisungo: it does. xbps-reconfigure -f zfs
Jun 09 20:50:29 <ahesford>	aedinius: sounds like you've got another 18 years to worry about that problem
Jun 09 20:51:14 <sisungo>	EConnMan Package also has bugs.
Jun 09 20:52:06 <sisungo>	But I think it is not a bug from package, it may from source.
Jun 09 20:52:16 <sisungo>	But also may from package.

Jun 09 21:05:04 <ahesford>	has the chroot installation PR been merged?
Jun 09 21:05:06 <sisungo>	I changed /bin/void-installer
Jun 09 21:05:19 <sisungo>	Then I installed Void Linux Root on NILFS2
Jun 09 21:05:25 <sisungo>	But NilFS2 may died
Jun 09 21:05:31 <sisungo>	Because kernel panic
Jun 09 21:05:56 <zdykstra>	and I'm personally partial to zfsbootmenu as the definitive way to do root on ZFS - I'd be game to take my tested and known-good documentation and adapt it to the Void docs standard
Jun 09 21:06:10 <sisungo>	When I mount a NILFS2 part, the kernel will panic.
Jun 09 21:06:35 <ahesford>	zdykstra: that would be my preference
Jun 09 21:07:14 <ahesford>	just have to remove the ESP-on-USB nonsense and you're good to go ;)
Jun 09 21:07:24 <sisungo>	Is NILFS2 still maintaining?
Jun 09 21:07:24 <zdykstra>	already done :)
Jun 09 21:07:29 <sisungo>	Or already dead!
Jun 09 21:07:50 <aedinius>	sisungo: I had never heard of it until now so I dunno

Jun 09 22:04:42 *	Topic for #voidlinux set by maldridge (Mon Nov 12 23:13:20 2018)
Jun 09 22:05:56 <ni694458>	Can I use GFS2 on one machine?
Jun 09 22:06:16 <aedinius>	Never heard of this one either
Jun 09 22:06:38 <ahesford>	GFS2 can be used on one machine, but without some features
Jun 09 22:06:47 <ni694458>	Thanks.
Jun 09 22:06:57 <aedinius>	> It was originally written for SGI's IRIX operating system, but in 1998 it was ported to Linux
Jun 09 22:07:00 <aedinius>	I approve of this.
Jun 09 22:07:00 <ni694458>	I want to use Void Linux Root on GFS2.
Jun 09 22:07:11 <ahesford>	I expect you'll have a bad time
Jun 09 22:07:29 <ni694458>	But why will I have a bad time?
Jun 09 22:07:39 <ahesford>	All I know of GFS2 is from Wikipedia, but it doesn't look like root filesystem material
Jun 09 22:07:40 <ni694458>	Is Root on GFS2 terrible?
Jun 09 22:07:52 <aedinius>	I don't know if its  supported on Void as root
Jun 09 22:08:26 <ahesford>	If you think ZFS is too difficult to install, GFS2 would be a whole new level
Jun 09 22:08:48 <ni694458>	I know why modprobe failed now
Jun 09 22:09:01 <ni694458>	Because the LiveCD has two kernels
Jun 09 22:09:13 <ni694458>	And the ZFS module will be installed to the newer kernel
Jun 09 22:09:17 <ni694458>	But the kernel to start is old
Jun 09 22:09:32 <ni694458>	How can I install ZFS Module to Old Kernel?
Jun 09 22:09:34 <ahesford>	`xbps-reconfigure -f zfs` will build the module for both kernels
Jun 09 22:10:14 <ni694458>	Thank you.
Jun 09 22:11:23 <ni694458>	How can I install kernel headers for specificed kernel version?
Jun 09 22:11:35 <aedinius>	xbps-install linuxX.X-headers
Jun 09 22:14:06 <deadguy>	this looks like a job for INSTALL GENTOO
Jun 09 22:14:14 <deadguy>	... yeah, i know. i'll see myself out
Jun 09 22:15:23 <ni694458>	Installing ZFS-Root Void Linux may more difficult than Installing Gentoo.
Jun 09 22:16:14 <aedinius>	Didn't someone link zdykstra's guide?

Jun 09 23:04:39 <zdykstra>	well, you have a self-assigned IP, so I'm guessing 'ip route sh' doesn't have a gateway
Jun 09 23:05:03 <zdykstra>	and if you did manually assign an IP, you'll need to also configure a gateway, and configure /etc/resolv.conf
Jun 09 23:05:45 <ahesford>	poobie[m]: you can `rm /var/service/dhcpcd` and then `cd /etc/sv/dhcpcd && ./run` to see if dhcpcd prints any useful info

Jun 09 23:19:25 <ericonr>	zdykstra: so you use it as ane environment around ssh?
Jun 09 23:19:36 <zdykstra>	these days, yeah, and even that sparingly
Jun 09 23:19:48 <ericonr>	heh
Jun 09 23:19:58 <ericonr>	ahesford: are you asking because of the haiku 2 beta release?
Jun 09 23:20:08 <zdykstra>	I just mostly boot the laptop to remind myself of how much I loved BeOS, and how many things have changed in 20 years
Jun 09 23:20:15 <ahesford>	No, because aedinius made a comment about befs being fast
Jun 09 23:20:23 <poobie[m]>	I'm still getting the same address even without self assigning on my system
Jun 09 23:20:26 <poobie[m]>	idk where it's coming from
Jun 09 23:20:35 <sisungo>	BeOS ?
Jun 09 23:20:39 <zdykstra>	self refers to your laptop assigning it, not you
Jun 09 23:21:00 <ahesford>	How different the world might have been had Apple bought Be
Jun 09 23:21:10 <ericonr>	ahesford: ooh I see
Jun 09 23:21:19 <zdykstra>	I actually owned a dual 133mhz BeBox for a while
Jun 09 23:21:26 <ericonr>	I didn't know enough to make the connection
Jun 09 23:21:31 <zdykstra>	I wish I hadn't sold that
Jun 09 23:22:13 <ericonr>	I know it's probably due to nostalgia, but no one complains about haiku/beos on the internet
Jun 09 23:22:23 <ericonr>	so all I know about it is that it was loved
Jun 09 23:22:26 <zdykstra>	oh, plenty of people do on the haiku forums
Jun 09 23:22:34 <ahesford>	Uh, not nostalgia. Small user base.
Jun 09 23:22:38 <poobie[m]>	so why would my dhcpcd be assigning this address
Jun 09 23:22:42 <poobie[m]>	and why is it not an actual connection
Jun 09 23:22:46 <ericonr>	ahesford: isn't BeOS nostalgia?
Jun 09 23:22:51 <zdykstra>	poobie[m]: because it's not getting a lease from a dhcp server
Jun 09 23:23:00 <nbm>	BeOS is nostalgia but haiku isn'
Jun 09 23:23:03 <nbm>	isn't
Jun 09 23:23:18 <ericonr>	zdykstra: fair enough. I have never ventured into those
Jun 09 23:23:33 <quinq>	poobie[m], this is ugly zero-conf sillyness enabled by default
Jun 09 23:23:35 <aedinius>	ahesford: I'm torn
Jun 09 23:23:55 <aedinius>	ahesford: ObjC wouldn't have had its revival and C++ would've had another booster
Jun 09 23:24:13 <ahesford>	True
Jun 09 23:24:26 <q66>	i'd be fine with that
Jun 09 23:24:38 <q66>	ObjC bad

Jun 09 23:25:42 <zdykstra>	Gassee was pretty brilliant in his own right
Jun 09 23:26:04 <ahesford>	But Jobs had sheer determination
Jun 09 23:26:07 <zdykstra>	I read a series of articles by him recently about the growth and subsequent demise of BeOS - he had some business acument
Jun 09 23:26:09 <zdykstra>	acumen
Jun 09 23:26:41 <aedinius>	I have a book that covers Gassee's stint at Apple and then the BeOS vs NeXT acquisition
Jun 09 23:26:42 <zdykstra>	but fuck, he broke my heart when it was apparent that he doesn't actually give a shit about tech. He literally claimed that Haiku "might be based on stolen BeOS source code"
Jun 09 23:26:45 <aedinius>	Fantastic book
Jun 09 23:26:59 <sisungo>	Where is void-installer?
Jun 09 23:27:02 <zdykstra>	aedinius: i'd be interested in reading that - what's it called?

Jun 11 09:25:08 <duncaen>	no idea about dbus, afaik you can't just set it dbus-launch would set it, but then you might have to different dbus sessions for your runsvdir and for your xorg session
Jun 11 09:26:42 <duncaen>	you are getting into complex setups

Jun 11 09:28:46 <duncaen>	so yea its a Xorg service you only want to run under xorg
Jun 11 09:28:59 <duncaen>	but your runit user services run always, before xorg might start
Jun 11 09:29:21 <duncaen>	and dbus and xorg have the concept of sessions which doesn't work well with how you setup your runit user servicesx
Jun 11 09:29:37 <hyper_dave>	Is there a way to run them after logging in?
Jun 11 09:30:34 <duncaen>	not really
Jun 11 09:30:48 <hyper_dave>	I guess it is all about dependent services right?
Jun 11 09:30:52 <duncaen>	what I personally do is run a different service directory when I start xorg
Jun 11 09:31:06 <duncaen>	so instead of executing a window manager, my xinitrc executes runsvdir
Jun 11 09:31:15 <aedinius>	cinerea0: I'm not sure, usually they go with the application or into the general icons directory

Jun 11 10:02:37 <grosjean>	egrain: there's an option in kodi

Jun 11 10:02:47 <grosjean>	https://kodi.wiki/view/Basic_controls#Power_Options
Jun 11 10:02:58 <grosjean>	dunno if it's working
Jun 11 10:02:59 <ahesford>	the question is whether kodi just calls `shutdown`, `reboot` or `poweroff`, or if it uses loginctl
Jun 11 10:03:16 <ahesford>	`reboot` and `poweroff` are not polkit aware
Jun 11 10:03:27 <ahesford>	`loginctl reboot` and `loginctl poweroff` are
Jun 11 10:03:46 <egrain>	grosjean, that's not the issue. you need sudo to init 0. therein lies the problem.
Jun 11 10:03:57 <gid>	it definitely goes through polkit
Jun 11 10:04:09 <ahesford>	shutdown can't "go through polkit"
Jun 11 10:04:13 <grosjean>	okidoki
Jun 11 10:04:23 <ahesford>	you need a polkit-aware program to do the shutdown
Jun 11 10:04:38 <ahesford>	loginctl will use polkit for authorization
Jun 11 10:04:52 <ahesford>	the system `shutdown`, `reboot` and `poweroff` commands do not use polkit
Jun 11 10:04:54 <grosjean>	and what about this one: https://yingtongli.me/blog/2016/12/23/kodi-power.html
Jun 11 10:05:06 <grosjean>	using polkit
Jun 11 10:05:27 <ahesford>	polkit just handles authorization
Jun 11 10:05:43 <ahesford>	the shutdown and reboot programs need to know to ask polkit if a user can run them
Jun 11 10:05:54 <ahesford>	like I said, Void's shutdown, reboot and poweroff do not
Jun 11 10:06:11 <grosjean>	ack
Jun 11 10:06:14 <ahesford>	you need kodi to call `loginctl poweroff` and the like if you want to configure polkit
Jun 11 10:06:28 <gid>	ahesford: as far as I'm aware, kodi tries to shut down using a polkit-aware method
Jun 11 10:06:29 *	sigjen (~sigjen@205.201.49.83) has joined
Jun 11 10:06:45 <ahesford>	the problem is that systemd systems might have polkit-aware poweroff and reboot binaries

Jun 11 10:08:02 <egrain>	i'll get over there and ask later.

Jun 27 21:14:31 <atomicbeef>	do most people use something like vlogger to view their logs?

Jun 27 22:17:00 <chili-b>	Hey I have a problem with audacity. Can someone help me?
Jun 27 22:18:04 <ericonr>	zdykstra ahesford: do you think it would make sense for zbm to include an update utility that does automatic snapshots when there are updates to certain packages? Like kernel/zfs/dkms stuff?
Jun 27 22:18:17 *	emmett1 (~emmett1@1.32.119.157) has joined
Jun 27 22:18:27 <ericonr>	chili-b: I've never used it :o
Jun 27 22:18:37 <ericonr>	but shoot
Jun 27 22:20:22 <chili-b>	It used to work when I used ALSA, but now that I've switched to pulseaudio it has stopped. Whenever I try to record something it gives "Error opening recording device, Error code -9997 Invalid sample rate"
Jun 27 22:20:38 <chili-b>	My sample rate is set to 44100 Hz in pulseaudio as far as I know
Jun 27 22:22:26 <chili-b>	When I open audacity the light on my microphone turns on and the immediately turns off.
Jun 27 22:22:29 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: and you said pulse worked so well
Jun 27 22:23:03 <ericonr>	any reason you can't return to ALSA?
Jun 27 22:23:11 <ericonr>	xzcvczx: it does for me :p
Jun 27 22:23:38 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: pulse always was rubbish, is rubbish and so long as the universe exists will be rubbish
Jun 27 22:25:10 <ericonr>	well something on the device needs to match me c:
Jun 27 22:25:32 <chili-b>	Just using alsa has some incompatibilities with some other programs. It works fine on my laptop (same software) so I think it's some issue with audacity not liking my hardware...
Jun 27 22:26:29 *	mrwater (~mrwater@185.230.125.140) has joined
Jun 27 22:27:05 <chili-b>	okay this is really weird... I just changed the audio input away from the default one to some other random one and then all of a sudden my microphone showed up.
Jun 27 22:27:10 <helby>	rubbish!
Jun 27 22:27:55 <chili-b>	ericonr: also related to audacity I would like to update the package to version 2.4.2. Is the checksum for the source SHA-256?
Jun 27 22:28:07 <helby>	like all nonsense incompatibile with alsa
Jun 27 22:28:53 <mrwater>	Does anybody happen to know what non-systemd computers use instead of nss-resolve? My void computer doesn't seem to need an extra service for DNS lookup.
Jun 27 22:29:17 <aedinius>	mrwater: typically libc does the lookup
Jun 27 22:29:18 <ericonr>	chili-b: yup! You can see info about that in the Manual.md file
Jun 27 22:31:02 <ericonr>	aedinius: we will need your cookbook as a void package, btw
Jun 27 22:31:48 <aedinius>	ericonr: I can arrange that.
Jun 27 22:32:05 <aedinius>	/usr/doc/cookery
Jun 27 22:32:25 <mrwater>	aedinius: Okay, I must have a fundamental misunderstanding of something. Isn't libc a package with C header files?
Jun 27 22:32:49 <ericonr>	aedinius: it's so important that it skips /usr/share/doc ?
Jun 27 22:33:17 <ericonr>	mrwater: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library
Jun 27 22:33:28 <ericonr>	it's the header files _and_ the implementation
Jun 27 22:34:03 <aedinius>	ericonr: yes
Jun 27 22:34:53 <mrwater>	Okay, sure, that's what I thought. So in my head libc doesn't look up dns stuff, a program does, using libc. Right?
Jun 27 22:35:35 <ericonr>	no, a part of libc is responsible for DNS lookup
Jun 27 22:35:38 <aedinius>	mrwater: well, typically its libc itself. something else might, depending on the system...
Jun 27 22:36:09 <ericonr>	aedinius: even in those cases, it's usually libc that will ask some other service about DNS stuff, not the program itself
Jun 27 22:36:18 <aedinius>	ericonr: Right
Jun 27 22:36:31 <aedinius>	At minimum libc will still be the interface
Jun 27 22:36:31 <ericonr>	I should configure unbound sometime, btw
Jun 27 22:36:42 <aedinius>	I have dnsmasq forward to unbound
Jun 27 22:36:50 <ericonr>	do I need both?
Jun 27 22:37:01 <ericonr>	I mostly want to have some local caching
Jun 27 22:37:15 <mrwater>	Basically I want to avoid running an extra service on a machine with archlinux when there doesn't seem to be a use for such a service in Void.
Jun 27 22:38:00 <ericonr>	I'm not sure I catch your drift
Jun 27 22:38:02 <mrwater>	Also trying to fill the gap in my knowledge
Jun 27 22:38:14 *	Redfoxmoon has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
Jun 27 22:38:20 <ericonr>	does arch enable systemd-resolved?
Jun 27 22:38:32 <aedinius>	ericonr: I think so
Jun 27 22:38:43 <mrwater>	ericonr: That seems to be what it intends for me to do
Jun 27 22:39:46 <ericonr>	hmm does it need dhcpcd enabled too?
Jun 27 22:39:58 <helby>	no by defauld in arch
Jun 27 22:40:01 <ericonr>	cause you need something to get you an IP addr
Jun 27 22:40:05 <mrwater>	I have dhcpcd and wpa_supplicant enabled just like on my void computer
Jun 27 22:40:11 <aedinius>	ericonr: that's a client thing
Jun 27 22:40:14 <mrwater>	There is a network connection, but no dns. That's my issue
Jun 27 22:40:30 <ericonr>	check what's in /etc/resolv.conf
Jun 27 22:40:38 <mrwater>	resolv.conf is populated. I can ping the dns service in there
Jun 27 22:40:43 <ericonr>	huh
Jun 27 22:40:50 <ericonr>	aedinius: wdym?
Jun 27 22:41:01 <aedinius>	I'm misunderstanding the question
Jun 27 22:42:01 <aedinius>	So on my server I have dhcpcd, but it sets a static IP (I can't remember why I didn't just set statically, iirc it would lose the IP)
Jun 27 22:42:20 <aedinius>	But it runs dnsmasq for dhcp server, and unbound for actual lookups
Jun 27 22:42:29 <aedinius>	Everything local looks to it for lookups
Jun 27 22:42:38 <helby>	mrwater: do u have nameserver in resolv.conf?
Jun 27 22:42:49 <mrwater>	helby: yes. 1.1.1.1
Jun 27 22:43:03 <mrwater>	currently. I tried it with the nameserver that the network gave me
Jun 27 22:43:11 <helby>	oh so u already did some fakery there
Jun 27 22:44:00 <mrwater>	fakery?
Jun 27 22:44:21 <helby>	doubt that 1.1.1.1 came after your installation :)
Jun 27 22:44:38 <aedinius>	That might be what his network assigns..
Jun 27 22:44:46 <helby>	no, it's not
Jun 27 22:45:09 <mrwater>	Even if I take that option out of dhcpcd.conf and release, I get the same issue
Jun 27 22:45:31 <helby>	maybe dhcpd need to be restarted? not sure
Jun 27 22:45:33 <aedinius>	helby: You're pretty sure what my dhcp assigns me on my network?
Jun 27 22:46:00 <helby>	aedinius: no, bc. we are not talking about your modem 56 kb/s network :)
Jun 27 22:46:50 <aedinius>	helby: that modem is in a bag in the back of my house.
Jun 27 22:47:13 <mrwater>	I've restarted dhcpcd every time dhcpcd.conf is edited, which is a lot because I'm trying to see if it's an issue with the server
Jun 27 22:47:23 <helby>	mrwater: u probably set up something wrong, I have a minimal install just with that dhcpd and it works without any crap, changed namerserver in dhcpcd.conf like u and everything is okay
Jun 27 22:47:31 <ericonr>	aedinius: oh, I thought unbound could be a dns server too
Jun 27 22:47:42 <aedinius>	ericonr: yeah it is, I'm using that
Jun 27 22:48:03 <ericonr>	I should look into what dnsmasq does
Jun 27 22:48:05 <aedinius>	ericonr: I'm using dnsmasq for local resolution, and then it forwards to dnsmasq for non-local
Jun 27 22:48:09 <mrwater>	helby: Yeah, on void with runit, it IS okay. That's my entire point. I'm trying to learn why systemd needs an extra service for dns lookup when runit doesn't
Jun 27 22:48:14 <agrisis>	ok I think I determined that softlinking libs don't work as I had thought w.r.t ldconfig
Jun 27 22:48:14 <aedinius>	ericonr: dnsmasq is local dhcp+dns
Jun 27 22:48:15 <ericonr>	aedinius: ooh
Jun 27 22:48:25 <helby>	mrwater: u have systemd?
Jun 27 22:48:27 <ericonr>	so stuff like local servers?
Jun 27 22:48:42 <mrwater>	helby: Not on my computer, but on my phone which currently has archlinux installed, I do
Jun 27 22:48:50 <agrisis>	ldconfig won't pick up different libs linked to the same file, like libEGL.so and libGLESv2.so if they're linked to the same file
Jun 27 22:49:02 <helby>	mrwater: the issue with dns is on that systemd machine or ?
Jun 27 22:49:11 <mrwater>	helby: yes-
Jun 27 22:49:22 <helby>	mrwater: systemd need that resolved crap usually
Jun 27 22:49:30 <helby>	with networkd too
Jun 27 22:49:47 <aedinius>	Why are we talking about systemd here, how is it relevant?
Jun 27 22:50:07 <helby>	like in arch wiki, u have to create new config for your network interface
Jun 27 22:50:16 <helby>	who knows, I thought he has issue with with void
Jun 27 22:50:53 <helby>	but it showed that's the machine of friend of his friend which run arch as virtual machine in someting else on someone else machine
Jun 27 22:51:43 <helby>	mrwater: regarind arch, it has the best wiki form linux world, so u will find your answers there
Jun 27 22:51:51 <helby>	from
Jun 27 22:51:59 <helby>	fucking keyboard
Jun 27 22:52:02 <helby>	fucking systemd
Jun 27 22:52:28 <mrwater>	aedinius: I guess it's relevant as an educational tool because it's introduced me to a function that voidlinux handles without any added complexity
Jun 27 22:52:49 <helby>	so in the end instead of send emails I evaluate to possibilities to create another web omg
Jun 27 22:52:55 <ericonr>	which honestly sounds like the opposite of what usually happens
Jun 27 22:53:01 *	user has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Jun 27 22:53:41 <mrwater>	Maybe it's less complex to add an entire service for dns resolution. That's what I'm trying to learn about
Jun 27 22:53:59 <helby>	mrwater: u dont need to use systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved for networking/dns there is also dhcp/net or something like that packages
Jun 27 22:54:03 *	user (~user@static-50-43-47-143.bvtn.or.frontiernet.net) has joined
Jun 27 22:54:50 <aedinius>	mrwater: or that systemd adds complexity to
Jun 27 22:55:17 <mrwater>	helby: I figured. But why would I even need those packages when wpa_supplicant and dhcpcd seem to do the job on every other machine I use?
Jun 27 22:55:21 <aedinius>	mrwater: void does it like it was done for decades before systemd did their thing, is my point
Jun 27 22:55:31 <helby>	also here dhcpd do work, there is that systemd which can do the same work, but u have two separate services inside of it for that job
Jun 27 22:55:59 <helby>	mrwater: u don't need a lot of things in many distros what are there
Jun 27 22:56:19 <helby>	mrwater: u use probably bootloader, but systemd has bootloader too for example
Jun 27 22:56:31 <helby>	mrwater: at end u don't need bootloader at all
Jun 27 22:56:59 <ericonr>	if you don't boot the computer, you don't need anything at all
Jun 27 22:57:12 <aedinius>	That's my usual go to.
Jun 27 22:57:19 <helby>	remember few years ago default arch base contains netctl, dhcpc , so 3 services inluding systemd for just network which all did the same job
Jun 27 22:57:25 <aedinius>	(I still haven't found pppppppowerbook)
Jun 27 22:57:30 <helby>	ericonr: u are smart, I knew it :)
Jun 27 22:58:23 <helby>	ericonr: for me it just sounds as nonsense, that if some distro include systemd, then their base include fucking services/packages that just duplicate job what systemd can do
Jun 27 22:58:44 <helby>	ericonr: bc. if some idiot decided that systemd is good, then they should use it at least
Jun 27 22:59:27 <ericonr>	well, you don't have to commit to using everything systemd ships
Jun 27 22:59:40 <helby>	at least no fuckering with systemd in void, we have just grub and pulseaudio and other 'cool' crap for that
Jun 27 22:59:44 <ericonr>	stuff like chrony is a much better impl of NTP than whatever systemd will probably ever have
Jun 27 22:59:59 <ericonr>	so it makes sense to enable it
Jun 27 23:00:15 <mrwater>	aedinius: Yeah, I gather that void does things that way. I'm just trying to restore that base functionality in another context
Jun 27 23:00:23 <helby>	ericonr: yes remember chrony in alpine linux, add like 3 seconds on boottime compared to busybox or ntp or what is was called
Jun 27 23:01:34 *	johnvan has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jun 27 23:01:34 <helby>	ericonr: not all function, but still, I will not include shitty ancient gimp if I need to browse 3 photos :)
Jun 27 23:03:19 <helby>	ericonr: to be honest I was relativelly happy with systemd in arch, I avoided to install many packages bc. was able to use systemd services
Jun 27 23:07:04 <helby>	ericonr: also arch is not a bloat now, they don't include any crap in base
Jun 27 23:08:26 <helby>	includes probably less than void base-system
Jun 27 23:08:55 <ericonr>	hmm likely
Jun 27 23:09:02 <ericonr>	we have stuff like wpa_supplicant
Jun 27 23:09:11 <helby>	for fuck sake
Jun 27 23:09:21 <helby>	netlify don't know how to send emails
Jun 27 23:10:04 <helby>	ericonr: but void has base-minimal ... what is not obvious and did not find anything about it in docs
Jun 27 23:11:29 <helby>	but I installed from live iso with installer first time, then found some info, so uninstalled everything from chroot and install crap again
Jun 27 23:11:34 <ericonr>	we mention base-voidstrap here https://docs.voidlinux.org/installation/guides/chroot.html#install-base-system-rootfs-method-only
Jun 27 23:11:48 <ericonr>	not base-minimal, though
Jun 27 23:11:54 <ericonr>	not sure I'd like to recommend it :p
Jun 27 23:12:02 <helby>	why? there is everything needed
Jun 27 23:12:43 <helby>	void does not have any extensive docs or wiki where u can find all packages/application
Jun 27 23:12:48 <helby>	so many cool are hidden
Jun 27 23:12:55 <helby>	nobody know about them probably
Jun 27 23:13:11 <helby>	if somebody did not tell me about base-minimal in irc, I would probably did not it exists
Jun 27 23:13:25 <ericonr>	https://voidlinux.org/packages/
Jun 27 23:13:44 <ericonr>	but yeah, you'd have to search for something like `base-` and go through results
Jun 27 23:13:50 <helby>	well but .... can't search for something I don't know it exist
Jun 27 23:14:20 <helby>	also not sure who, maybe even u recommend me pam_rundir for setting up auto xdg_dir for sway
Jun 27 23:14:32 <helby>	helpful package, how the fuck I would find it
Jun 27 23:15:39 <helby>	there are probably many good packages but nobody knows about them :)
Jun 27 23:16:08 <helby>	so everybody by default install the same crap like grub, pulse and so on ...
Jun 27 23:16:44 <helby>	that fucking randomit sleeping , not here more
Jun 27 23:17:18 <ericonr>	sleep is good
Jun 27 23:17:31 <ericonr>	pam_rundir I will document at some point
Jun 27 23:19:10 <aedinius>	sleep is great.

Jun 27 23:24:00 <helby>	systemd-sleep ?
Jun 27 23:24:34 *	skalle has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Jun 27 23:24:36 <helby>	holy crap, just found it really exists
Jun 27 23:24:48 <helby>	everything is there, just still not systemd-browser
Jun 27 23:25:14 <Tashtari>	People are so worried about Amazon taking over the world that they're paying no mind to systemd...
Jun 27 23:28:16 <Tashtari>	In other news >_<  Does anyone have any idea why lxd is firing this error?  "lxd: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libdqlite.so.0: undefined symbol: sqlite3_wal_replication_unregister"
Jun 27 23:28:52 <Tashtari>	I'm really kind of stuck here.  st3r4g said it sounds like an issue with sqlite vs sqlite-replication, but I'm not quite sure what they meant.
Jun 27 23:31:09 <ericonr>	Tashtari: have you tried installing sqlite-replication too?
Jun 27 23:31:20 <Tashtari>	It's installed, it's required by dqlite.
Jun 27 23:31:53 <ericonr>	I see
Jun 27 23:31:59 <ericonr>	hang on
Jun 27 23:32:19 <Tashtari>	Both sqlite and sqlite-replication are installed.  I think dqlite requires sqlite as well, though I'm not sure how.
Jun 27 23:32:20 <ericonr>	it's not the `bin` version, right?
Jun 27 23:32:34 <Tashtari>	No, sqlite-replication-bin is not installed.
Jun 27 23:33:33 <ericonr>	I expected the bin version to be a pre-compiled one, but it's literally the binary from the package
Jun 27 23:33:35 <ericonr>	oh well
Jun 27 23:39:14 <ericonr>	hmm I'm trying to rebuild it, idk if it's necessary
Jun 27 23:40:02 <ericonr>	Tashtari: do you have a Github account? Might help to open an issue about it
Jun 27 23:40:20 <ericonr>	have you tried `xbps-pkgdb -a` too to check if all files exist?
Jun 27 23:43:59 <Tashtari>	ericonr: The command returns no output.
Jun 27 23:44:15 <ericonr>	seems like all is fine, then
Jun 27 23:45:57 <Tashtari>	There are so few search results that mention this error, but one of them is here: https://www.gitmemory.com/fosslinux ... Google's clip from the page says "@CameronNemo I get lxd: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/libdqlite.so.0: undefined symbol: sqlite3_wal_replication_unregister trying to run this on my pi." ... which would be encouraging as cameronnemo is the package maintainer for dqlite and for lxd, but
Jun 27 23:45:59 <Tashtari>	the page when it loads has no such text on it.
Jun 27 23:46:27 <ericonr>	huh, that's fossy
Jun 27 23:46:45 <Tashtari>	What even is gitmemory?
Jun 27 23:47:43 <ericonr>	no idea
Jun 27 23:47:53 <ericonr>	sounds like a website for stalking people on GH
Jun 27 23:49:18 <Tashtari>	I would love to find out where that comment is from, but it doesn't appear in any of the void-packages issues...
Jun 27 23:49:47 <Tashtari>	oop, found it, it's in a pull request.
Jun 27 23:51:21 <ericonr>	Tashtari: how do I test the package?
Jun 27 23:51:29 <ericonr>	Do I need to configure anything?
Jun 27 23:51:43 <Tashtari>	I don't think so.  I started getting the error the moment I started the service.
Jun 27 23:51:59 <ericonr>	hmm
Jun 27 23:52:11 <ericonr>	if you run just `lxd` in the terminal it happens too?
Jun 27 23:52:21 <ericonr>	also, which platform are you on?

Jun 27 23:52:55 <Tashtari>	Yeah, happens when I run it on the terminal too.
Jun 27 23:53:02 *	Selo (~Selo@176.213.53.181) has joined
Jun 27 23:53:06 <Tashtari>	amd64, or x86-64 or whatever it's called now.

Jun 27 23:57:40 <ericonr>	I assume you've tried updating too?
Jun 27 23:57:57 <Tashtari>	Yeah, nothing to update.
Jun 27 23:58:00 <ericonr>	do note that the glibc test was from a chroot

Jun 28 00:02:51 <ericonr>	hmm
Jun 28 00:03:20 <ericonr>	try running it with `LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/sqlite-replication/libsqlite3.so.0`
Jun 28 00:03:37 <Tashtari>	running lxd?
Jun 28 00:03:40 <ericonr>	yeah
Jun 28 00:03:47 <ericonr>	that might get you the symbol you need
Jun 28 00:04:16 <Tashtari>	Well, it at least got me a different error.  This time the symbol it can't find is "dqlite_init".
Jun 28 00:04:22 <ericonr>	it really shouldn't, because ldd says it can find the library just fine
Jun 28 00:04:59 <ericonr>	have you messed with configuration files for ld?

Jun 28 00:08:39 <ericonr>	dqlite__init with two underscores comes from /usrlib/libdqlite.so.0 if you want to try to preload that too
Jun 28 00:08:54 <ericonr>	LD_PRELOAD=/first/path:/second/path
Jun 28 00:09:08 <Tashtari>	Hm.  :(  It didn't do it on my vm ether, though I've just realized the vm is i686, not x86_64...
Jun 28 00:09:21 <ericonr>	oops
Jun 28 00:09:48 <Tashtari>	Nah, adding the second path to LD_PRELOAD doesn't help, it still complains of not being able to find dqlite_init.
Jun 28 00:09:54 <Tashtari>	(With only one underbar.)
Jun 28 00:10:26 <ericonr>	also, are you using up to date mirrors?
Jun 28 00:11:15 <Tashtari>	..hmm.
Jun 28 00:12:07 <Tashtari>	I'm using alpha.de.repo.voidlinux.org
Jun 28 00:12:17 <ericonr>	yeah that can't be outdated
Jun 28 00:12:53 <ericonr>	you can always do something like `xbps-install -f lxd dqlite sqlite sqlite-replication` and see if it sticks
Jun 28 00:12:57 <ericonr>	unless you've already done that

Jun 30 20:24:26 <randombit>	takes time.
Jun 30 20:25:30 <randombit>	i wanted to figure out how it would be possible to make a dynamic website with a compiled language, and so that the client will not need to use JS.
Jun 30 20:26:04 <randombit>	just. clean. web.
Jun 30 20:27:03 <ericonr>	most WASM stuff needs some JS glue here and there
Jun 30 20:27:19 <randombit>	in this way, if there would be a forum framework with C, C++, the mail, or even feed integration would be direct.

Jun 30 20:29:01 <ericonr>	makes sense
Jun 30 20:30:49 <randombit>	that https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt looks promising. could be glued with other stuff. has already some widgets. and simple html "render"

Jun 30 20:34:56 <Vagabond>	uh huh
Jun 30 20:35:10 <randombit>	good q Vagabond. i was thinking about it too. but probably because to. idk. prettier? or taking some rendering off from server?

Jun 30 20:39:58 <randombit>	faster code. faster forum. mail. right beside. and any other compiled library what you heart desire.

Jun 30 21:43:40 <ahesford>	one of my cats is calm and sweet. the other is sweet until he bites.
Jun 30 21:43:44 <skalle>	well I mean they're great if you want to get up with the sun
Jun 30 21:44:11 <Nilium>	Most of my cats will play-bite but nothing beyond that.
Jun 30 21:44:26 <ahesford>	he plays but doesn't jnow his limits
Jun 30 21:44:44 <Nilium>	The larger siamese cat will grab your hand with his paws after you stop petting him and pull it back to his head
Jun 30 21:45:02 <Nilium>	Also, I am blessed with cats who love tummy rubs.
Jun 30 21:45:09 <ahesford>	my two cats hate each other, probably because of the 12-year age gap

Jun 30 23:16:06 <KevS>	not my grub.cfg but the default one that is used to generated the grub config when the kernel gets updated
Jun 30 23:16:30 <xzcvczx>	KevS: well whats the problem with it then?
Jun 30 23:16:57 <xzcvczx>	as in what are you trying to achieve?
Jun 30 23:16:59 <KevS>	i stripped it down because it used modules that i didnt include in my coreboot image and i have since added those modules while fixing a different issue with s3

Jun 30 23:18:35 <ericonr>	xzcvczx: ZFS isn't only that
Jun 30 23:18:41 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: ah ok
Jun 30 23:18:59 <ericonr>	it's kind of hard to extrapolate a ZFS install from the chroot instructions
Jun 30 23:19:13 <ericonr>	sisungo: are you on UEFI or BIOS?

Jun 30 23:26:41 <KevS>	i got a slice for it too (mostly cause the battery for the x230t is an oblong tumor that makes it very uneven on the desk)
Jun 30 23:27:00 <xzcvczx>	slice?

Jun 30 23:29:13 <KevS>	might not even really matter all that much if we never have in-person class again :/
Jun 30 23:30:48 <xzcvczx>	ah ok
Jun 30 23:31:31 <xzcvczx>	KevS: what i would recommend is backup your grub configuration files in /etc/ and triple check the replacements when you reinstall grub
Jun 30 23:31:44 <xzcvczx>	oh wait
Jun 30 23:31:52 <xzcvczx>	i still don't understand what you changed
Jun 30 23:32:04 <xzcvczx>	was it something in /etc/ or just /boot/efi/grub.cfg?
Jun 30 23:32:08 <xzcvczx>	or /boot/grub.cfg
Jun 30 23:32:12 <KevS>	it was in etc
Jun 30 23:32:36 <KevS>	i changed /boot/efi/grub.cfg but it undid my changes everytime the post-update hooks ran so i changed the default one as well
Jun 30 23:32:45 <KevS>	didnt make a backup tho :(
Jun 30 23:33:10 <xzcvczx>	hmmmm whats the default?
Jun 30 23:34:34 <KevS>	hm yeah so i dont know if its from grub or if its from void itself. basically theres some scripts there that generate the grub.cfg when the kernel gets updated

Jun 30 23:42:16 <KevS>	yep that restored it
Jun 30 23:42:17 <ericonr>	have you taken a look at them?
Jun 30 23:43:12 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: yeah but thats only for new installs is it not?
Jun 30 23:43:17 <KevS>	lol if i had done that before i wouldnt have been in this situation now. i got it back to default though
Jun 30 23:43:25 <xzcvczx>	not those people who can't keep their damn fingers out the cookie jar
Jun 30 23:43:33 <KevS>	no theres stuff there about modifying the hooks. a little anyway
Jun 30 23:43:50 <xzcvczx>	KevS: now you owe me details from powertop :P
Jun 30 23:44:09 <ericonr>	xzcvczx: this very small part https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/kernel.html#grub
Jun 30 23:44:36 <xzcvczx>	ah lol
Jun 30 23:44:50 <xzcvczx>	yeah im reluctant to screw with the grub on my void, it works so i don't touch
Jun 30 23:45:13 <KevS>	what details are you looking for here? idle on tty i have a discharge rate of ~15W
Jun 30 23:45:24 <KevS>	est. remaining time ~8-9 hours
Jun 30 23:45:38 <ericonr>	15W on idle on tty???
Jun 30 23:45:40 <xzcvczx>	15W? thats high
Jun 30 23:45:43 <xzcvczx>	i have 9
Jun 30 23:45:45 <xzcvczx>	and thats high
Jun 30 23:46:10 <xzcvczx>	KevS: are you on battery or ac?
Jun 30 23:46:31 <KevS>	battery, just unplugged before i ran powertop
Jun 30 23:46:38 <ericonr>	I have 13W from CPU but I have lots running too
Jun 30 23:47:07 <xzcvczx>	KevS: shit and you get 8-9 hours out of that

Jun 30 23:47:13 <xzcvczx>	you must have a huge ass battery
Jun 30 23:47:32 <KevS>	theres 2 batteries lol
Jun 30 23:47:41 <KevS>	each is a 6 cell i believe
Jun 30 23:47:53 <KevS>	i cant figure out why its so high though
Jun 30 23:48:05 <KevS>	i didnt realize that was a high value
Jun 30 23:48:24 <xzcvczx>	press tab
Jun 30 23:48:26 <xzcvczx>	so you get to tunables
Jun 30 23:48:30 <xzcvczx>	and see if shits bad
Jun 30 23:48:51 <xzcvczx>	so/until
Jun 30 23:48:53 <KevS>	2/3 of it is bad
Jun 30 23:49:04 <xzcvczx>	did you run sudo powertop?
Jun 30 23:49:08 <KevS>	yep
Jun 30 23:49:08 <xzcvczx>	or as a luser?
Jun 30 23:49:16 <KevS>	as root, couldnt run as a user
Jun 30 23:49:24 <xzcvczx>	then press enter, down, enter, down
Jun 30 23:49:25 <xzcvczx>	etc
Jun 30 23:49:28 <xzcvczx>	until they all say good
Jun 30 23:49:39 <xzcvczx>	and then press tab again
Jun 30 23:49:43 <xzcvczx>	disable WoL
Jun 30 23:49:49 <ericonr>	`powertop --autotune` or whatever works too
Jun 30 23:49:58 <xzcvczx>	adn then press tab to return to first screen and see if it looks more reasonably
Jun 30 23:49:58 <ericonr>	and you don't need to do it manually
Jun 30 23:50:01 <xzcvczx>	reasonable
Jun 30 23:50:12 <ericonr>	it doesn't save the changes though, does it?
Jun 30 23:50:12 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: meh i prefer to do it manually because you get to see just how bad things are
Jun 30 23:50:20 <xzcvczx>	ericonr: nah on reboot its gone
Jun 30 23:50:30 <xzcvczx>	you need to run powertop --autotune on boot
Jun 30 23:50:35 <anddam>	howdy
Jun 30 23:50:41 <anddam>	what time zone are you guys?
Jun 30 23:50:56 <xzcvczx>	KevS: although prior to putting powertop --autotune in boot make sure nothing goes to shit stability wise
Jun 30 23:51:03 <xzcvczx>	otherwise you may need to disable some powersaving
Jun 30 23:51:10 <xzcvczx>	anddam: NZ
Jun 30 23:51:11 <KevS>	shit man im still at 12W
Jun 30 23:51:23 <KevS>	im America/Chicago
Jun 30 23:51:33 <anddam>	xzcvczx: ah ok makes sense
Jun 30 23:52:01 <xzcvczx>	anddam: how come?
Jun 30 23:52:06 <KevS>	about to be 11 pm here for me
Jun 30 23:52:09 <anddam>	I remember seeing your nicks active, but in my CET is a bit early
Jun 30 23:52:19 *	xzcvczx plays the worlds smallest violin for KevS :)
Jun 30 23:52:25 <anddam>	seemed an unusual discussion for 5:30 AM
Jun 30 23:52:26 <xzcvczx>	anddam: ah fair enoguh,
Jun 30 23:52:31 <anddam>	no, almost 6 now
Jun 30 23:52:46 <xzcvczx>	haha its 5:30am and you already lagging by 22mins
Jun 30 23:53:11 <anddam>	I'm a slow starter at 5 AM

Jun 30 23:53:29 <KevS>	how the fuck am i using 12W
Jun 30 23:53:54 <xzcvczx>	oh and my 9W is whilst running firefox
Jun 30 23:54:07 <xzcvczx>	and i have the i7
Jun 30 23:54:13 <xzcvczx>	KevS: oh wait
Jun 30 23:54:19 <xzcvczx>	KevS: turn down ya damn brightness
Jun 30 23:54:24 <xzcvczx>	it ain't the middle of the day
Jun 30 23:55:59 <KevS>	lol yep its dropping now
Jun 30 23:56:11 <KevS>	let you know when it stabilizes
Jun 30 23:57:18 <xzcvczx>	why you have brightness so dang high :P
Jun 30 23:57:25 <flexibeast>	anddam: 1400 here.
Jun 30 23:57:38 <KevS>	i had a really really bright lamp on
Jun 30 23:57:44 <xzcvczx>	lol
Jun 30 23:57:58 <xzcvczx>	KevS: have you done a screen upgrade on yours?
Jun 30 23:58:30 <KevS>	i have not, since its the tablet lol not sure what my options for that are (if any)
Jun 30 23:58:40 <anddam>	flexibeast: but you were not talking before!
Jun 30 23:58:43 <anddam>	cheater
Jun 30 23:58:51 <KevS>	seems to be leveling out towards 8W now, it drops by a bit less each time
Jun 30 23:59:10 <xzcvczx>	KevS: ah fair enoguh, i am currently waiting on a screen and keybaord for mine

Jul 01 00:00:15 <KevS>	1st keyboard i ordered broke after like a day. just got the replacement one, the 2 key doesnt work
Jul 01 00:00:26 <anddam>	what hardware are you talking about?
Jul 01 00:00:29 *	anddam scrolls back
Jul 01 00:00:35 <flexibeast>	andax: .... sorry, you've lost me. :-)
Jul 01 00:00:35 <KevS>	so im trying to get another one and for now i just said fuck it and took the one from my t420
Jul 01 00:00:40 <flexibeast>	*anddam even
Jul 01 00:00:44 <anddam>	ah thinkpad
Jul 01 00:00:51 <KevS>	anddam i have an x230t and he has an x230

Jul 01 00:01:54 <anddam>	flexibeast: I mean I asked for the timezone since the guys were talking at an unusual (for me) hour, you weren't in the lines I could see so I playfully said "cheater" to your answer
Jul 01 00:02:08 <anddam>	KevS: I have been thinking about getting one
Jul 01 00:02:34 <anddam>	I got a chromebook hoping to be able to use chromeos for media consuming and its Linux environment for real stuff
Jul 01 00:02:44 <xzcvczx>	KevS: oh i am doing the backlit keybaord mod
Jul 01 00:02:51 <xzcvczx>	as i quite like chiclet
Jul 01 00:02:58 <anddam>	the experience was very sub-par and I almost exclusively use my desktop
Jul 01 00:03:00 <flexibeast>	anddam: Oh i see. Yeah, i'm only active on IRC on and off, as i do other things.
Jul 01 00:03:02 <KevS>	i just got the x230t but ive been using arch on a t420 for the past year or so
Jul 01 00:03:15 <anddam>	flexibeast: I was joking anyway
Jul 01 00:03:19 <anddam>	time to get a coffee
Jul 01 00:03:26 <xzcvczx>	KevS: gah i can't stand arch
Jul 01 00:03:32 <xzcvczx>	its the poor mans gentoo
Jul 01 00:03:32 <anddam>	oh and you were talking bootloaders!
Jul 01 00:03:39 <xzcvczx>	with systemd just to really annoy you
Jul 01 00:03:45 <xzcvczx>	anddam: i have skulls :)
Jul 01 00:03:45 <KevS>	ahh yeah i probably wouldnt have minded the chiclet keyboard THAT much but i got used to the keyboard on the t420
Jul 01 00:03:59 <KevS>	you know what though, arch was a good experience i would say
Jul 01 00:04:03 <xzcvczx>	KevS: i assume you did the old'school keybaord mod?
Jul 01 00:04:27 <xzcvczx>	KevS: you obviously never used gentoo or something better thna arch prior to arch
Jul 01 00:04:30 <anddam>	I am trying to figure why refind is not listing my 5.7 kernel image, but if finds my 5.4 perfectly fine
Jul 01 00:04:30 <KevS>	yep the old school mod. ripped the keyboard off my t420 until a non-broken one comes
Jul 01 00:04:39 <KevS>	lol no i didnt. arch was my first distro
Jul 01 00:04:47 <xzcvczx>	anddam: was /boot/efi mounted?
Jul 01 00:04:53 <xzcvczx>	when you installed the kernel
Jul 01 00:05:02 <anddam>	yes, I do see the images there
Jul 01 00:05:14 <anddam>	erm sorry,
Jul 01 00:05:20 <anddam>	I see the images in /boot, obviously
Jul 01 00:05:38 <anddam>	/boot/efi is mounted but IIRC refind does no need a grub-update equivalent
Jul 01 00:05:43 <KevS>	i think gentoo would be a great experience too but i learned a TON breaking and fixing my arch install
Jul 01 00:05:43 <xzcvczx>	yeah but if its not mounted you may have pout the grub config in the folder rather htan mounted
Jul 01 00:05:45 <anddam>	it will do its magic at runtime
Jul 01 00:05:51 <KevS>	only thing i miss is the AUR
Jul 01 00:05:57 <xzcvczx>	KevS: i hated aur
Jul 01 00:06:01 <xzcvczx>	i found it so second class
Jul 01 00:06:09 <KevS>	i will say
Jul 01 00:06:18 <anddam>	I adopted void since I did not like ABS
Jul 01 00:06:22 <KevS>	i needed the aur to install nerd fonts and such
Jul 01 00:06:23 <xzcvczx>	xbps-src is decent but i prefer something else, but as this is the void channel i won't steal their thunder :)
Jul 01 00:06:38 <anddam>	xzcvczx: really? what is it?
Jul 01 00:06:42 <KevS>	but like, on void manually installing fonts is so straightforward
Jul 01 00:06:51 <KevS>	yeah ^^ what is it
Jul 01 00:06:56 <xzcvczx>	hah, kiss anddam
Jul 01 00:07:25 <anddam>	I think xbps-src is kiss enough
Jul 01 00:07:37 <xzcvczx>	kiss linux :)
Jul 01 00:07:54 <xzcvczx>	is a from-source for the most part
Jul 01 00:08:03 <xzcvczx>	exluding a few packages like firefox
Jul 01 00:08:15 <xzcvczx>	and requires making ya own kernel/config
Jul 01 00:08:21 <xzcvczx>	but it just boots so damn quickly
Jul 01 00:08:32 <KevS>	oh yeah i bet
Jul 01 00:08:40 <xzcvczx>	like bios is now the slowest part for me by far
Jul 01 00:08:55 <KevS>	can you internal flash off of skulls?
Jul 01 00:08:59 <xzcvczx>	KevS: yes
Jul 01 00:09:11 <xzcvczx>	thats partly what its designed for
Jul 01 00:09:12 <anddam>	hmmmm    Executing post-install kernel hook: 50-refind ...
Jul 01 00:09:15 <xzcvczx>	is internal flashing to heads
Jul 01 00:09:23 <anddam>	where are the kernel hooks installed?
Jul 01 00:09:25 <xzcvczx>	or really anywhere else ya wanna go
Jul 01 00:09:35 <KevS>	ah i did the whole clip thing
Jul 01 00:09:46 <xzcvczx>	yeah i had to clip to get skulls installed
Jul 01 00:09:52 <xzcvczx>	and nuke my me
Jul 01 00:10:04 <KevS>	oh im thinking of 1vyrain then
Jul 01 00:10:14 <xzcvczx>	ah k
Jul 01 00:10:22 <KevS>	yeah i nuked me (and disabled it in kernel cause i hate those messages)
Jul 01 00:10:41 <KevS>	id really suggest a grub image if bios is the longest part of your boot
Jul 01 00:10:53 <xzcvczx>	is it not a module? can you not just tell it to not load in config?
Jul 01 00:10:56 <xzcvczx>	well in /etc/
Jul 01 00:11:30 <xzcvczx>	i was sorta hoping to get rid of grub, just unfortunately thats rather impractical
Jul 01 00:11:30 <KevS>	the longest part of my boot is the idle timer in grub lol
Jul 01 00:11:45 <xzcvczx>	yeah i am tempted to take mine back to 1s
Jul 01 00:12:06 <KevS>	thats why you just stick grub on the eeprom :D
Jul 01 00:12:12 <anddam>	do you even ever use the grub menu?
Jul 01 00:12:14 <xzcvczx>	i wish you could just set it to only stop if you hold something through boot
Jul 01 00:12:23 <xzcvczx>	anddam: can be useful for recovery
Jul 01 00:12:27 <anddam>	sure
Jul 01 00:12:33 <anddam>	but do you even ever use it?
Jul 01 00:12:39 <anddam>	actually
Jul 01 00:12:42 <xzcvczx>	KevS: if you stick a cd/thumb drive in does it pick it up in grub?
Jul 01 00:12:50 <KevS>	anddam i chainload nvramcui to switch on bios settings
Jul 01 00:13:03 <KevS>	hmm i can test that out and let you know
Jul 01 00:13:05 <xzcvczx>	KevS: what sort of bios settings?
Jul 01 00:13:55 <KevS>	ive been having an s3 issue where the machine crashes on suspend. i never got to figure out what caused it but it just stopped
Jul 01 00:14:18 <KevS>	but i disabled bluetooth with nvramcui cause some of the error messages zzz gave me were bluetooth related
Jul 01 00:14:27 <xzcvczx>	oh
Jul 01 00:14:37 <anddam>	ha, the refind hook did the trick
Jul 01 00:14:38 <xzcvczx>	can't say i have had any errors from zzz re bluetooth
Jul 01 00:14:49 <anddam>	I should investigate what it did, though
Jul 01 00:14:56 <xzcvczx>	but yeah i lvoe zzz so simple and clean
Jul 01 00:15:02 <xzcvczx>	i use it on kiss
Jul 01 00:15:15 <KevS>	im pretty sure my errors came from something with my coreboot image cause they didnt happen on stock bios
Jul 01 00:15:55 <KevS>	so the usb doesnt come up in the grub menu, i need to figure out how to add hooks for that into that /etc/grub.d path
Jul 01 00:16:05 <xzcvczx>	you got the orig broadcom b20802 or whatever it is
Jul 01 00:16:08 <KevS>	but if i quit to shell i can see (usb0,gpt1)
Jul 01 00:16:25 <xzcvczx>	KevS: hmmmm yeah ok, and hooks won't help you
Jul 01 00:16:34 <xzcvczx>	unless you just always have a usb option there
Jul 01 00:16:36 <xzcvczx>	thats rather annoying
Jul 01 00:16:47 <KevS>	yeah whatever bluetooth chip was in here, im gonna assume the previous owner didnt change it
Jul 01 00:16:51 <xzcvczx>	not that i very often need to boot off usb
Jul 01 00:16:54 <KevS>	oh i dont mind having a usb option there
Jul 01 00:16:58 <xzcvczx>	i guess manual at cmd line could work
Jul 01 00:17:14 <KevS>	i keep a tails stick on my keys

Jul 01 00:22:53 <KevS>	not sure whats happening there it just stops scrolling down and i cant fix it without reconnecting
Jul 01 00:22:57 <anddam>	how do I tell refind to start a specific version from a menuentry?
Jul 01 00:23:27 <anddam>	I mean it's listing both 5.4 and 5.7 in my Void entry, but it's using the oldest as default
Jul 01 00:24:19 <KevS>	never used refind but in grub the menu entry in the config file specifies a kernel version
Jul 01 00:24:38 <xzcvczx>	ummm you can reorder in your uefi settings
Jul 01 00:24:44 <xzcvczx>	nfi how to do it from system though
Jul 01 00:24:49 <xzcvczx>	efivars might have something
Jul 01 00:24:56 <xzcvczx>	i only had efi for about 1hr
Jul 01 00:25:06 <xzcvczx>	before i went all goth and installed skulls
Jul 01 00:26:08 <KevS>	so for autotune should i just throw that in my profile or something or is there a better way to run that on boot
Jul 01 00:26:29 <KevS>	also: i discovered that my brightness defaults to high on each reboot, dunno how to fix that
Jul 01 00:27:00 <xzcvczx>	/etc/rc.local probably
Jul 01 00:27:11 <xzcvczx>	could put that in ya /etc/rc.local as well
Jul 01 00:27:30 <xzcvczx>	and yeah i hate how it defaults to max brightness
Jul 01 00:28:34 <KevS>	this is my biggest issue
Jul 01 00:28:45 <KevS>	today was supposed to be xmonad day
Jul 01 00:29:05 <KevS>	but i keep getting distracted and i never know what order to work on this stuff in/what to configure first

Jul 01 00:30:08 <randombit>	haskell?
Jul 01 00:30:15 <xzcvczx>	but yeah i am beginning to love tiling wm
Jul 01 00:30:26 <xzcvczx>	randombit: yeah ya know haskell
Jul 01 00:30:50 <randombit>	i know, but what i dunno is why it sucks
Jul 01 00:30:57 <KevS>	yeah i really like xmonad-contrib
Jul 01 00:31:05 <KevS>	haskell is the language xmonad is written in
Jul 01 00:31:12 <xzcvczx>	meh i appreciate the simplicity of dwm
Jul 01 00:31:25 <KevS>	i actually am switching over from dwm
Jul 01 00:31:41 <xzcvczx>	lol you splitter
Jul 01 00:31:48 <KevS>	switched back to alacritty too
Jul 01 00:32:41 <xzcvczx>	and let me guess you left the peoples front of judea as well
Jul 01 00:33:01 <KevS>	i used to use bspwm but i found i prefer dynamic tilers
Jul 01 00:33:42 <randombit>	https://wiki.haskell.org/wikiupload/a/aa/Screen-triplehead-galois.jpg   <<----  It's my MOUSE!!!!
Jul 01 00:34:14 <xzcvczx>	oh god, that keyboard
Jul 01 00:34:18 <xzcvczx>	it would drive me nuts
Jul 01 00:34:53 <xzcvczx>	and that mouse is made wrong
Jul 01 00:35:14 <randombit>	whats wrong with it
Jul 01 00:35:52 <KevS>	that keyboard would drive me nuts too
Jul 01 00:35:55 <xzcvczx>	how awkward it looks, and i occasionally need to use the keybaord one handed if on my phone or something and that would be really annoying
Jul 01 00:36:10 <KevS>	"on your phone"
Jul 01 00:36:20 <KevS>	suuuure
Jul 01 00:36:33 <xzcvczx>	KevS: i must say i appreciate a tiling wm due to coming from a macbook touchpad to the x230, the touchpads just don't compare
Jul 01 00:36:38 <xzcvczx>	get ya mind out the gutter
Jul 01 00:37:01 <KevS>	tiling wms are what got me to make the switch to linux
Jul 01 00:37:09 <xzcvczx>	from?
Jul 01 00:37:15 <KevS>	windows
Jul 01 00:37:27 <KevS>	partially that and partially cause my surface died
Jul 01 00:37:27 <xzcvczx>	ew.... a real terminal got me to stop going back
Jul 01 00:37:49 <xzcvczx>	thats why macos has satisfied me for the past few years
Jul 01 00:38:26 <KevS>	yeah i needed a new computer and also nothing annoys me more than having to move my hand between the keyboard and mouse
Jul 01 00:38:44 <xzcvczx>	has the 230t got the nipple?
Jul 01 00:38:46 <KevS>	add in how much i hate windows
Jul 01 00:38:51 <KevS>	oh you bet it does
Jul 01 00:39:00 <KevS>	its the same keyboard as the mainline x230
Jul 01 00:39:20 <xzcvczx>	oh ok
Jul 01 00:39:34 <xzcvczx>	so the only differnce is touchscreen? or it can also 180 screen onto bottom?
Jul 01 00:39:55 <KevS>	it can 180 screen onto the bottom
Jul 01 00:40:16 <xzcvczx>	meh i prefer a tablet for a tablet
Jul 01 00:40:22 <KevS>	its an IPS display, touchscreen, and the pen is the real reason i got it
Jul 01 00:40:23 <xzcvczx>	as i only use tablet for reading
Jul 01 00:40:34 <xzcvczx>	ah ok, i am waiting on an ips screen for mine
Jul 01 00:40:41 <xzcvczx>	its stuck getting out of china
Jul 01 00:40:53 <KevS>	i have a kindle for reading, and i really missed my surface for taking notes

Jul 01 00:42:12 <xzcvczx>	oh are you still in preschool? then i can sorta understand being able to "write"
Jul 01 00:42:18 <xzcvczx>	or draw
Jul 01 00:43:21 <KevS>	hey now
Jul 01 00:43:33 <KevS>	im actually all the way up in 2nd grade
Jul 01 00:43:53 <xzcvczx>	oh so you at the scribbling stage :P
Jul 01 00:44:19 <KevS>	thats what anyone who tries to read my writing says
Jul 01 00:45:20 <xzcvczx>	haha mines no better
Jul 01 00:45:46 <xzcvczx>	o_O fedora is looking at dropping bios
Jul 01 00:48:29 <KevS>	hmm
Jul 01 00:48:51 <KevS>	i mean yeah its probably about that time
Jul 01 00:49:39 <xzcvczx>	rahter disappointing when seabios is seen as more stbale than tianocore
Jul 01 00:49:52 <xzcvczx>	KevS: did you customise your coreboot logo?
Jul 01 00:50:06 <KevS>	i dont even have a splash screen i go straight to grub menu
Jul 01 00:50:12 <xzcvczx>	damn you microsoft, i keep looking up the top for releases
Jul 01 00:50:17 <xzcvczx>	oh ok
Jul 01 00:50:20 <xzcvczx>	how long does that take?
Jul 01 00:50:46 <KevS>	like half a second for the screen to turn on after i hit the power button
Jul 01 00:50:48 <anddam>	KevS: refind does not use listed entries, its default is to probe for bootable (in his view) EFI bootloader and chain those

Jul 01 00:51:11 <KevS>	yeah im not sure then unfortunately anddam
Jul 01 00:51:15 <anddam>	xzcvczx: " ummm you can reorder in your uefi settings"  <-- was that for me?
Jul 01 00:51:23 <xzcvczx>	yeah
Jul 01 00:51:36 <xzcvczx>	when i had uefi i could reorder the boot list in bios/uefi settings
Jul 01 00:53:10 *	skalle (~skalle@ip-173-118-23-157.chcgil.spcsdns.net) has joined
Jul 01 00:55:22 <anddam>	xzcvczx: but in UEFI only the bootloader are listed, not the EFI stubs
Jul 01 00:55:40 <anddam>	i.e. I have a grub and a refind entry, that's about all the order I can set
Jul 01 00:56:02 <anddam>	then refind does its runtime magic and list the EFI stubs, including all the kernels on all partitions it can read

Jul 01 00:56:25 <xzcvczx>	oh ok, then i really have nfi
Jul 01 00:56:29 *	jgbyrne has quit (Ping timeout: 258 seconds)
Jul 01 00:56:33 <anddam>	my issue is that it's listing lexicographically (I figure)
Jul 01 00:56:42 <anddam>	so 5.4 comes before 5.7 and first is default
Jul 01 00:56:47 <anddam>	boy it's hot already here
Jul 01 00:57:04 <xzcvczx>	KevS: do you use an email client or just gmail web?
Jul 01 00:57:26 <KevS>	neomutt
Jul 01 00:58:14 <KevS>	i used to use a wizard for it but on this machine i wanna try writing those configs myself so i can learn

Jul 04 23:58:07 <pitch>	i am too dumb for regexp.... can please someone tell me how to egrep an word starting with XF86??
Jul 04 23:59:54 <llimllib>	pitch `\bXF86`?
Jul 05 00:00:11 <llimllib>	https://gist.github.com/llimllib/fd71c0431fde4c6bd83749529dadcd8f
Jul 05 00:00:26 <Nilium>	For a word starting with it, you'd need to probably do something like \bXF86.
Jul 05 00:00:50 <Nilium>	Nevermind, llimllib covered it fine
Jul 05 00:01:00 <llimllib>	\b is short for "word boundary", fwiw, that's how I remember it anyway
Jul 05 00:02:37 <pitch>	egrep -o \bXF86
Jul 05 00:02:50 <Nilium>	Remember to use single quotes around it
Jul 05 00:02:52 <pitch>	wont print all words starting with XF86
Jul 05 00:03:32 <pitch>	okay it is matching now.
Jul 05 00:03:38 <pitch>	but onlt XF86 not the whole word
Jul 05 00:03:52 <pitch>	its like mathcig literal XF86
Jul 05 00:04:03 <Nilium>	Yeah, you need to complete your regexp to cover the rest of the word.
Jul 05 00:04:10 <llimllib>	something like `grep -Eo \bXF86[a-zA-Z1-9]*\b`
Jul 05 00:04:31 <llimllib>	that time I forgot the quotes
Jul 05 00:04:44 <llimllib>	(egrep is deprecated in favor of grep -E, IIRC)
Jul 05 00:05:06 <pitch>	egrep IS grep -E
Jul 05 00:05:08 <llimllib>	yup
Jul 05 00:05:26 <llimllib>	there's a character class you can use to match better than that made up one too
Jul 05 00:05:28 <pitch>	just a sophisticated alias
Jul 05 00:05:32 <llimllib>	I just always have to look up the syntax for it
Jul 05 00:05:35 <llimllib>	yup, I know
Jul 05 00:05:44 <pitch>	i know its S
Jul 05 00:06:12 <pitch>	printable symbols without whitespace
Jul 05 00:06:14 <llimllib>	`[:alnum:]`
Jul 05 00:06:22 <Nilium>	Something liek \bXF86([[:alnum:]_-]+|$) may work for basic cases

Jul 05 00:06:30 <pitch>	i am just too tired to get it...
Jul 05 00:06:59 <Nilium>	\bXF86([[:alnum:]_-]+|\b) even.
Jul 05 00:07:22 <nbm>	this template doesnt even have "arch" property https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/zsh/template
Jul 05 00:07:24 *	b has quit (Quit: Lost terminal)
Jul 05 00:07:33 <llimllib>	(which also won't work on bsd grep, because nothing is easy)
Jul 05 00:07:37 <nbm>	how does it come
Jul 05 00:07:39 <Nilium>	nbm: Most templates don't have an arch property.
Jul 05 00:07:52 <nbm>	not having arch property = noarch ?
Jul 05 00:08:02 <Nilium>	Not having one means all architectures.
Jul 05 00:08:07 <nbm>	cool
Jul 05 00:08:28 <pitch>	cat wev.txt | egrep -o '\bXF86\S+' | uniq did the trick
Jul 05 00:08:41 <pitch>	thanks for helping
